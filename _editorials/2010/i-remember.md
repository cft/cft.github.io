I awoke this morning and began to think about salvation and the wonder of it all. Then the Holy Spirit reminded me that this very day, February 17, 2010 was the anniversary of my salvation 59 years ago. I was surprised. Could it be? I checked the calendar and sure enough. Today, as I write, is my spiritual birthday!

I awoke this morning and began to think about salvation and the wonder of it all. Then the Holy Spirit reminded me that this very day, February 17, 2010 was the anniversary of my salvation 59 years ago. I was surprised. Could it be? I checked the calendar and sure enough. Today, as I write, is my spiritual birthday!

I remember the night of my conversion to Jesus Christ. I was ready. God had prepared me well. Born into the family of a pastor, I had been nurtured in the things of God all through my childhood. My heart was tender toward God.

Now just barely 15 years of age, I went to a youth rally where a missionary was scheduled to speak. On that night there were 3,000 people gathered to hear the message of God's love and grace. I listened carefully.

When the invitation was given to go forward and receive Christ, I knew that this was my night. I was met by another young man, perhaps three or four years older than I. He led me from God's Word through the plan of salvation. Then he prayed with me to confess my sins and receive Jesus as my Savior and Lord. I became a Christian in that moment.

After the service, I went up to the missionary speaker, also a relatively young man of about 32 years of age, and asked for his autograph. He signed a piece of paper and then wrote a Scripture reference under his signature. That Scripture became my life-verse. It has guided and encouraged me for almost 60 years.

<blockquote>
  <p>Have I not commanded you?<br>
  Be strong and courageous.<br>
  Do not be afraid;<br>
  do not be discouraged,<br>
  for the LORD your God<br>
  will be with you wherever you go.</p>
  <footer>Joshua 1:9 TNIV</footer>
</blockquote>

Isn't that a great Bible verse? God has kept this promise to me. I can look back over the years and see his hand upon me in the good times and in the bad times. He has always been there for me. Great is his faithfulness!

I remember what followed my salvation:

I remember returning home after the service. I was so filled with the Holy Spirit and joy that I literally jumped and skipped my way home on the sidewalks, shouting and praising God. God had worked the miracle of salvation in my life. Everything was new. I told my parents of my salvation and they were glad!

I remember, the next day, the young man, who had pointed me to Christ and salvation in the Bible, called me on the phone to see how I was doing. He invited me to go with him to a church service on Sunday. I was doing fine and I accepted his invitation. And thus began the long process of spiritual nurturing and maturation. Most important was the habit I learned of daily, personal devotions of Bible reading and prayer. In this way I came to know Jesus better and to become like him.

I also remember beginning to serve the Lord with the gifts God had given me. Soon we formed a youth evangelistic team. We went around to churches in our town and shared the Word of God. Yes, I was 15 years of age when I began to preach. I knew deep in my heart that I was called to the ministry as my father and grandfather had been. And following my Bible school and seminary training I was ordained and spent a lifetime of service on both the mission field and in the pastorate, teaching and preaching the Word of the LORD.

Now my greatest desire is that my children and their families and my grandchildren and their families will all follow the Lord Jesus in their lives as my wife and I have endeavored to do. I believe that God is raising up godly generations.

And what I wish for my family I also wish for you, my reader. If you are not already a Christian, I want you to know that God loves you. He has a wonderful plan for your life. But first you must confess your sins and receive Jesus as your Savior from sin and make him the Lord of your life. Then you will discover the wonderful plans God has for you, just as I discovered his plans for my life. But this is a decision only you can make.

It is so good to be a Christian! This world is so messed up with personal and national dysfunction. But God has provided a way to get our lives (our thoughts, emotions, and actions) straightened out on a personal level. That way is through the sacrificial death of his Son, Jesus, on the cross. One day he will get the nations of this world straightened out as well. Jesus will reign as King of kings and Lord of lords.

If you are already a part of the family of God, I rejoice. If not, I invite you to receive Jesus Christ today. God is calling you. You will never regret this decision&mdash;the same one I made nearly 60 years ago.

I remember what he did for me. I know he will do the same for you.

I am praying for you!
