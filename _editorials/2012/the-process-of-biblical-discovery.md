I enjoy teaching God's Word, but I love even more the process of discovery that classes require of me. For me this process always includes "WOW moments," similar to that of a brilliant sunrise or an amazing rainbow. It is like the discovery of a $20 bill in your suit jacket you had totally forgotten about. It is like the startling twist of a phrase of a child that gives you a new appreciation for an object you had long taken for granted, such as the time our little daughter called the trash can a "bash can" or a waterfall a "uh oh wawa," as if water were not meant to fall. Opening the Bible and letting its gold nuggets fall out into your lap is a very special experience. I thought I'd share a few ways I have engaged this "process of discovery" in the Bible.

I always begin with a chapter in the Bible, not a verse but a chapter. It doesn't matter which one. Each has its own treasures. Begin reading, expecting to find gold within these pages. Read the chapter asking yourself, "Who wrote this? Who are they writing to? What was going on in their life at the time they wrote it? Why are they writing this? What do they hope will happen when it is read?" These are critical questions for understanding your Bible chapter. Can you imagine how difficult it would be to understand a letter you randomly found sitting on the dining room table with the first and last pages missing, not knowing who wrote it or to whom it was being written?

Now read that Bible chapter four or five times, from beginning to end without a pause, not thinking too much about what you are reading. Let the words wash over you. Just get a feeling for this chapter. Every chapter in the Bible has its own rhythm, its own motion, its own action that you might miss if you initially investigate it too closely.

Then look for repeated words, special images or twists of phrases. Underline words you don't understand or that seem more important than other words. If ideas come to you, write them down. If they remind you of something, write that down. It could be something profound or funny or a story you once heard or a moment you experienced. Capture it in that moment because if you wait, you may not remember that golden nugget later.

Now it is time to open a good commentary to see if another scholar has come up with some insights that have not occurred to you. Ask yourself if their conclusions are credible, useful or consistent with the other things that you know to be true. Discard them if they are not. Keep them if they are. Believe me, there are some pretty smart people out there who can show you things you would never have thought about on your own.

Finally, pray about the words you have read, asking God to show you whatever you might have missed that He wants you to see in that chapter. Open your mind to whatever thoughts might come to you, correcting some of the foregone conclusions you might have had in the previous exercises. Thank God for this moment and these Truths that would not be yours but for His Holy Spirit.

Most importantly, don't let this gold mine called "the Word of God" go unexplored. There are so many treasures here to enrich your day, your life and the lives of those around you,

Happy reading!
