My mind drifts back over half a century to Christmas in Rothenburg o.d.T. 1962. Our family had only recently arrived in Germany&mdash;father, mother and one young son. Yet another boy was born in this fabled, medieval, walled city soon after our arrival. We were now a family of four facing our first Christmas in Deutschland.

It was quite an adjustment for all of us. My favorite book next to the Bible was the English/German dictionary. To prepare baby food for our newborn infant demanded the use of the dictionary, since the printed directions were all in German. I was even hesitant to answer the doorbell, since I did not yet understand the language.

We were in Rothenburg to study the German language for the next two years at the renowned Goethe Institute. With time and a lot of hard work, we all learned to understand and speak the language of our newly chosen country of residence. In fact, in time we could even think in German. It was an amazing transformation. I am sure God helped us.

There was, of course, purpose in all of this. We were not on a cultural enrichment program. We felt called of God to explain the Gospel (Good News) of Jesus Christ to German people and to teach college-aged students the content of the Holy Bible. All that would happen. But, crucial to a ministry of communication was a working knowledge of the language.

After about 11 months, I was asked to preach in a German church. I was ready for the challenge! I had time to prepare a full manuscript to read my sermon before a German audience. An elderly gentleman-citizen of Rothenburg reviewed my manuscript to be sure that both the grammar and the idiom were in correct form. Gradually other such preaching invitations came my way.

After a year and a half in Rothenburg, an unique opportunity was given me by the German YMCA (CVJM). I was invited to bring a Christmas Eve devotional meditation out in a forested area. I didn't know quite what to expect. There was nothing in my background that paralleled this.

Christmas Eve arrived and I left my family for a few hours to minister in a new and different environment. We drove to the site. As I remember, there were about 20 men and older boys who trudged through the snowy forest to a clearing.

It was night. And it was cold. Each person had a candle that was now lit to give light to the Christmas carols printed in their individual songbooks. And there in the moonlit forest, blanketed with snow, a group of 20 men and boys in overcoats, hats, wool scarves and gloves began to sing the traditional German Christmas carols. With melody we told the Christmas Story and gave praise to the God of Creation and Redemption for the gift of his Son, Jesus Christ, on that Christmas Day long ago. I then gave a short Bible meditation and we prayed. Then we made our way back to our cars and the warmth of our respective homes and families.

Germans celebrate two days of Christmas and it is always a quiet family observance. On Christmas Day I ventured out on the cobblestone street in front of our gabled apartment building. All was quiet and quite deserted. Almost no cars or people were seen. Nothing was stirring.

We decided to go to a local hotel for Christmas dinner. Off we walked to the hotel, as a family, all bundled up against the winter cold. We were welcomed warmly.

For dinner the main entree was roasted goose. What? Goose? No turkey? Well, that was another adjustment we had to make. We had a very wonderful feast by candlelight in a quiet environment.

I am sure we had our gift exchange after we arrived back home. But we were a little lonely&mdash;four souls in a new land with new customs to experience. If we learned anything from our first Christmas in Rothenburg it was the quiet and familial nature of "Weihnachten" in Germany. After all, it was an Austrian of German tongue who wrote the Christmas hymn so beloved by all&mdash;"Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht" (Silent Night, Holy Night).

Many years later, our two sons, now adults, and I made a pilgrimage to The Holy Land. We viewed many historical sights. One of the most sacred was our visit to Bethlehem. In the Church of the Nativity, perhaps one of the oldest churches in Christendom, we descended the steps to the traditional place where Jesus, the Christ, was born of the Virgin Mary. What a sacred and quiet place that must have been 2,000 years ago.

Even as we stood in prayer and adoration, 20 or 30 monks also descended the stairs chanting their a-cappella and haunting hymn of praise to the Son of God, made flesh. We call it "The Incarnation" (Ger. Die Fleischwerdung). We didn't understand their language (probably Latin), but we understood the spirit of their praise. It was another quiet and sacred moment.

With all the materialism rampant in the Western World in this 21st Century, particularly surrounding Christmas, it all seems far removed from the quiet, snow bedecked forest of Rothenburg and the traditional site of the Nativity in Bethlehem.

In my senior years at this Christmas season, I choose to find the quiet place, where I can contemplate the wonder of God the Father making his eternal Son flesh by the working of the Holy Spirit. And He did this not as some celestial stunt, but to demonstrate His great love for sinners such as we. He did it to give His incarnated Son as a sacrifice on the cross for our sins, so we could be forgiven and spend eternity with Him.

And this Jesus, who claimed to be God in the flesh, rose from the dead and ascended into heaven as final proof of his Divine Nature. You may read "The Gospel of John" in the New Testament for a complete explanation concerning who Jesus is and what he did for us.

Of course, it is up to each of us individually to say "yes" or "no" to God's offer of salvation through His Son, Jesus. I hope your response is a hearty "YES!" Ask God to forgive your sins and receive his free gift of eternal salvation.

There is no better time to do this than during this Christmas season. Find a quiet place and make your peace with the God, who loves you and gave His Son for your salvation.
