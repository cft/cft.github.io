Located against the San Gabriel Mountains in Southern California stands a Christian university founded in 1899. Today Azusa Pacific University (APU), with over 11,000 students, is on the cutting edge of preparing students in the Christian faith and stressing the value of a Christian worldview.

A financial donor to the university recently commented, "It is truly a blessing to give, but we have received even more that we have given-a joyous and satisfying life and blessings beyond our wildest dreams."

I have the unique privilege to visit with dedicated financial donors who through their generosity are making a difference in the lives of these university students. From time-to-time I write articles that feature their reasons, experiences, goals and joys for giving. As I speak with donors I often learn that they are not the super wealthy people listed in the Forbes magazine annual round-up of the wealthiest people in the world. Rather, they are everyday people who are motivated to give out of love, performing a service while strengthening their own Christian faith.

The donors I come in contact with know that giving to a Christian university is one of the best financial investments they can make. They are truly storing up their treasures in heaven (Matthew 6: 20-21). "Tell them to use their money to do good. They should be rich in good works and generous to those in need, always being ready to share with others. By doing this they will be storing up their treasure as a good foundation for the future so that they may experience true life" (1Timothy 6:18-19 - NLT, Second Edition).

The donors exemplify Matthew 6:21: "Your heart will be where your treasure is." Their generosity deepens their joy and reflects the words of Jesus: "There is more happiness in giving than in receiving" (Acts 20:35).

The motto of this Christian university is "GOD FIRST". Donors have frequently remarked that they put their money where they see God working. Each of these donors is not only a goodwill ambassador for the university, but also for the Kingdom of God. Their lives reflect the joy of giving and they honor "God First" with their generosity.

These people give because they see young people's lives being transformed at APU and making an impact on cultures as they spread the Gospel around the world. As one ninety year old donor said, "These students are our hope and promise for the future." Another donor stated, "You invest your life in something that you believe in - and you invest your finances in the same way." And yet another was so impressed that the students are encouraged to be involved in the world with a Christian perspective, he said, "They are truly bringing Jesus to the world."
These donors are teaching generosity and are glorifying God through their generous gifts (2Corinthians 9:13). What a model for all of us to follow! They are truly leaving a legacy of love because they practice and believe the words of King David in 1Chronicles 29:14: "Everything we have has come from you, Lord, and we can only give you what is yours already!"

The well-known author and pastor, Rick Warren, challenges us with eight reasons why we must practice generosity as a Christians so we, too, can leave our own legacy of love:

1. Generosity displays God's character
2. Generosity defeats materialism
3. Generosity draws me close to God
4. Generosity develops my love for other people
5. Generosity determines my blessings
6. Generosity deepens my joy
7. Generosity demonstrates my faith
8. Generosity is a deposit in eternity

Ask God to enlarge the grace of generosity in your life. It matters not whether you have much or little. We can all leave behind a generous legacy of love.
