All around the world we ring in a New Year&mdash;2012. It is a year of both concern and hope. Things might go very well or very badly.

#### Major Concerns

There are concerns enough. We face economic crises. The economies of the world are so interwoven now that what happens even in a small country affects the finances of world economic powers.

Jobs are needed world-wide. Unemployment is rampant. With the advance of technology, we are mechanizing everything to such a degree that the skills of millions, who work with their hands, are less and less needed&mdash;at least in my country. Yet, everyone cannot become a college graduate with math and science skills. That does not comprise the sum total of life. Many work with their hands and in the arts. Their skills are still needed. Greedy bankers and investors in the West must not mechanize and take off-shore the manufacturing base of a nation so that millions are idled. Workers cannot demand wages that far exceed the ability of employers to pay. Balance is the key&mdash;and hard to find.

War? There is plenty of that. The United States got out of Iraq after almost nine years of conflict. A good thing! That war, along with the on-going conflict in Afghanistan, has been draining the human and financial resources of many nations. One wonders if anything enduring has been accomplished. Time will tell. Terrorism is still a threat and will continue to be. Vigilance is called for.

Hunger and disease plague the planet. In particular, the Third World is pleading for the help of wealthy nations and world religions. The cries of the sick and hungry cannot be ignored. The United Nations along with China, Europe, The United States and Brazil, with world religions such as Christians, Buddhists, Moslems and Hindus need to step up and, guarding against corruption, make more food, medicine and health workers available to depressed areas of our world. Simple humanity demands these works of compassion. And what organized forces will not do, individuals must take the initiative to undertake.

#### Christian Hope

It is easy to be descriptive rather than prescriptive. I am neither an economist nor an international security specialist. Therefore, I will not venture to suggest specific remedies for all the global ills of humankind.

However, as a theologian I do have hope for the future. I am a Christian and so I speak from that perspective. Although New Testament prophecy does not offer much encouragement for this world in the short term, nevertheless I believe there is hope. There is still some compassion left in nations and a lot of it left in individuals.

My hope is rooted in the Bible. In the Old and New Testaments, if we listen to God, and his call for personal righteousness and social justice, we are promised ultimate peace and prosperity.

The prophet Isaiah, Chapter 65, gives us the promise of "a new heavens and a new earth." The description soars to new heights of optimism and hope.

"See, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind." (v.17).

That appeals to me. There is much I would like to ignore, if not forget in this present world. But the promise is there&mdash;new heavens and a new earth!

In the verses that follow (65:18-25) a beautiful picture is painted of longevity of life, houses, employment, contentment, healthy families, spiritual peace, harmony in nature, the end of wars, and the blessings of God. It gives us reason for hope and joy.

Again, the prophet, Isaiah, tells of the coming of a Messianic figure.

"Therefore the Lord (Adonai) himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will call him Immanuel (God with us)." (7:14).

"For unto us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government there will be no end &hellip; He will reign &hellip; with justice and righteousness &hellip; forever." (9:6-7).

The person the prophet describes is Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Jesus came to this earth (Christmas), lived a holy life, died on the cross for our sins, rose from the dead (Easter) and ascended into heaven. He is coming again with all power and authority to enforce righteousness and justice on this earth forever and ever.

The reason I have hope is not because I have faith in human nature. I do not. Rather I hope in Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God. He is the change agent. If we turn from our sins to Him, he will forgive us and give us the gift of eternal life. This is the source of the ultimate hope I carry in my heart as a Christian for humankind and for the renewal of the earth.

I offer you this hope.
