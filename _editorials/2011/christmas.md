Christmas Day is almost upon us once again. And with its coming all kinds of things flood our minds from shopping, decorating and religious observance.

I am struck by the difference there is between Christians and non-Christians in observing this special day. In the Western World there is a great secularization in progress. Many no longer say, "Merry Christmas", but rather "Happy Holidays." In other words, there is a great move on to take Christ out of Christmas.

In my country (U.S.A.) we have a growing number of Moslems, Hindus and Buddhists. Those of Jewish faith have been citizens almost from the beginning. We have freedom of religion and therefore I have no problem with those of other faiths sharing my country and the blessings of freedom.

However, since my country has been predominately populated by those of Christian faith (with a minority of Jewish faith), quite naturally Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, have been widely celebrated. Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox have joined together in these celebrations. But as the non-Christian population has increased, there has been some sensitivity to non-Christians who do not celebrate Christmas or Easter with us. I find this appropriate to a certain extent.

You see, the problem is, with the majority of my country celebrating Christmas, those of other religions want to celebrate with us since, seemingly, the whole culture is caught up in this. Therefore, what many of Christian persuasion have done is to try to secularize Christmas into some kind of a "winter holiday" that includes all the trappings of the Christian holiday called Christmas. Now it is observed as a winter holiday and we say "Happy Holidays" and give gifts and have parties and special foods and many drink their alcoholic beverages as well.

What amuses me is that I can walk through any of the main department stores such as Nordstrom's, Macy's, Penny's and even Wal Mart and hear all the Christmas carols being played-secular and religious - Rudolph, the Rednosed Reindeer, Someone Caught Mommy Kissing Santa Claus, and Jingle Bells - all being played right along with "O Little Town of Bethlehem," "Joy to the World," and "O Come, All Ye Faithful."

Not long ago I heard Charles Wesley's great Christmas Hymn being sung in a secular department store:

<blockquote>
  <p>Hark! the herald angels sing,<br>
  "Glory to the new-born King;<br>
  Peace on earth, and mercy mild,<br>
  God and sinners reconciled!"<br>
  Joyful, all ye nations, rise,<br>
  Join the triumph of the skies;<br>
  With the angelic host proclaim,<br>
  "Christ is born in Bethlehem!"<br>
  Hark! The herald angels sing,<br>
  "Glory to the new-born King."</p>
</blockquote>

And then, the second verse, which is filled with Christian theology:

<blockquote>
  <p>Christ, by highest heav'n adored;<br>
  Christ, the everlasting Lord;<br>
  Late in time behold Him come;<br>
  Off-spring of the Virgin's womb:<br>
  Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;<br>
  Hail the incarnate Deity,<br>
  Pleased as man with men to dwell,<br>
  Jesus, our Emmanuel.<br>
  Hark! The herald angels sing,<br>
  "Glory to the new-born King."</p>
</blockquote>

Then came the last verse:

<blockquote>
  <p>Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!<br>
  Hail the Son of Righteousness!<br>
  Light and life to all he brings,<br>
  Ris'n with healing in His wings.<br>
  Mild He lays His glory by,<br>
  Born that man no more may die,<br>
  Born to raise the sons of earth,<br>
  Born to give them second birth.<br>
  Hark! the herald angels sing,<br>
  "Glory to the new-born King."</p>
</blockquote>

Yes! Right in the most secular of department stores, the good news of Jesus was being sung-out loudly and clearly:

 - Jesus is the everlasting Lord. (King of kings)
 - Jesus is the incarnate Deity (Jesus is both man and God)
 - Jesus is our Emmanuel (God, with us)
 - Jesus came to give us a "second birth" (Spiritual re-birth)

What I am saying is, you cannot separate Christmas and the Christian faith. Atheists, agnostics and non-Christians should stop trying to do, what cannot be done. Non-Christians should just sit-out the Christmas season and not ask the predominately Christian population of my country to try to reshape Christmas into a secular winter holiday. It can't be done! The Christian mind-set is 2000 years old!

Christmas is all about the birth of Jesus, the Messiah promised in the Old Testament. Human beings have a spiritual problem called sin. We were separated from God and lost. God being righteous and just could not just overlook our rebellion. In love and mercy God, the Father, gave us God, the Son - Jesus Christ - to pay the penalty for our sins. All we have to do is turn from our sins (repentance) and request God's free gift of forgiveness and salvation. No more spiritual death. No more fear of death. "Light and life to all he brings!"

Jesus, born some 2,000 years ago in Bethlehem, is God's perfect gift to humankind - THE BEST GIFT OF ALL.

If God, the Holy Spirit, is prompting your mind and emotions to receive the offer of God's free gift of salvation, do it now! Confess to God that you are a sinner, that you now turn from your sins, that you receive God's gift of forgiveness and salvation and that you thrust the promises of God to do what you request.

Then find a church where the Bible, the Word of God, is taught and begin to grow in the grace and knowledge of Christ.

Welcome to the family of God!
