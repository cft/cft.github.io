In the book of Genesis God asked Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" Cain responded with some irritation, "I don't know. Am I my brother's keeper?" (Genesis 4:9).

God seems to be saying, we should know about our brothers and sisters&mdash;their whereabouts and needs. We tend to respond that we don't want to be bothered about the needs of our fellow human beings. We have enough problems of our own.

I will probably not soon forget the situation I observed. An older couple, in their middle to late 70s, was standing in front of a store. Suddenly the lady said to her husband, "my shoe is untied." She had her arm in a brace and obviously needed some help. Her husband hesitated for a moment to bend down and tie the shoe, not because he was unwilling to do so, but rather because he had some physical limitations of his own.

Suddenly, almost out of nowhere, a young man in his thirties appeared. With a bright smile on his face he said to the elderly woman, "May I tie your shoe?" Surprised she responded in the affirmative. "Yes you may! My husband has an arthritic hand and can't tie them so well." The young man said, "I'm younger. I'll do it!" And he bent down and tied the woman's shoe laces.

"Oh thank you," she responded. "And God bless you." And off went that cheerful and helpful young man&mdash;or was he an angel? He left behind two quite amazed seniors. When does anyone offer to be so helpful? Somewhat rarely. In that one small act they had experienced a marvel of love and grace.

Whether that young man was a Christian I know not. I can say, he certainly acted like one. Jesus told his followers to "love each other." In this way everyone would know that they are followers of Jesus Christ. (John 13:35) I really think that young man was a follower of Jesus. He indicated that by his loving action.

Once, Jesus was washing his disciples' feet&mdash;a messy job at best. They wore sandals in those days and needed to wash the dust of the road off their feet. Then Jesus told his disciples that they, too, should wash each other's feet. Admittedly, that was a humble and lowly act. The disciples of Jesus had been reluctant to perform this duty of a servant. But Jesus did it!

Since we don't wear sandals much anymore, I think Jesus would say to us,"you need to tie each others' shoes." If we see a need, whatever it is, we should step in and fill that need, if possible. In fact, Jesus went even further. He said, "Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends." (John 15:13) That's a high standard of friendship. But that's what Jesus did for us. He laid down his life on the cross for us, his friends. We ought to give ourselves freely to the needs of others.

There is no shortage of human need. So many around us are hungry, sick and poor. When we have the means, as Christian believers we have the opportunity and the privilege, even the obligation to feed the hungry, clothe the naked and care for the sick. Obviously, none of us can meet every need. But all of us can meet some need. Even if we can't do everything, we can do something. And when we do, we show the love of God to a very needy world.

When was the last time you bent down and tied someone else's shoe?
