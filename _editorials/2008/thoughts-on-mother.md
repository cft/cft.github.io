Every May we celebrate Mother's Day. It is a time to tell Mom we love her and how special she is.

Many give her flowers and take her out to Sunday dinner. If one lives a distance from Mother, a phone call is made. Moms wait for the phone to ring on this special day. Sometimes at church, a flower is given to all the Mothers on Mother's Day. In the past, the men used to wear a red carnation on the lapel of their coat if Mom was still living&mdash;a white carnation if she had already gone to heaven. A nice touch!

What makes a Mother so unique? It has to be her unqualified love for us. Good or bad, smart or average, beautiful or plain, Mother loves us just the same. There is nothing she will not do or give, if it will help us and is within her power to do so. It is a committed and unselfish love that never wavers. It is the closest thing to God's love that we can find on earth.

Sometime in our lives, whether early or late, we stop and reflect on our own responses to our Mother's expressions of love. When we have shown her love and respect in return, we feel real good down inside. If we have been disrespectful and downright neglectful, we have pangs of pain in our conscience. Hopefully, we resolve to do better in the future.

For some, Mother is gone. She died a few years ago. All we have left are memories that we treasure. Actually, we have much more! When we stop and think about it, much of how we live our lives is the result of the example and teachings of Mom. We see her alive and well in our thoughts and actions. There is simply no influence to compare with that of a Mother.

Admittedly, there were a few things that were less than perfect about Mom. Yes, we remember some of the flaws. She wasn't perfect, but neither are we for that matter. Over the years, we tend to block out the imperfections and remember only the positive things she contributed to our lives. Besides, Jesus died on the cross to redeem and change not only bad men, but also imperfect women. We all need the change that Jesus brings to fallen human nature.

When we think about God, we always think in masculine terms. That is entirely appropriate even in our diverse cultures. Nevertheless, God is neither male nor female. By nature he is both. All that is inherent in the highest concepts of Fatherhood and Motherhood is inherent in God Himself. All the love, tenderness and fierce loyalty of a Mother is found in God. He is the source of all these marvelous characteristics that comprise the nature of a Mother. How could it be otherwise in our Creator?

As this Mother's Day rolls around once again, take time to thank Mom for all she is and what she has meant to you. If she is no longer with us, at least take time to contemplate her life and the positive influence she had on you.

Above all, thank Almighty God for the gift of your Mother.
