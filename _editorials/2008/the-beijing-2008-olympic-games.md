Sixteen days in August 2008 were dedicated to the celebration of sport with some 200 countries of planet Earth participating. The host country, China, spent 40 Billion dollars to create the Olympic Village with spectacular venues and to host the Olympics. They did a splendid job. The centerpiece had to be the great coliseum, called the "Bird's Nest" seating 91,000 people.

The opening show featured 22,000 Chinese youth. And what a show it was! Who could forget it? The closing event only had 7,000 participants but was spectacular nonetheless. But what happened in-between the opening and the closing was what counted. The athletes competed and did their best to win a gold medal-or the silver or the bronze. Outstanding for me were the gold medal champions: sprinter Usain Bolt from Jamaica, swimmer Michael Phelps, all-around track and field athlete Bryan Clay, and the all-around gymnast Nastia Liukin-all from the United States of America, and many, many more.

As I watched the opening show, I thought to myself, one day I am going to be part of a future jubilee when Jesus Christ returns to earth. It will be incomparable. Revelation 19 tells the story (hear, Triumph of God, Revelation 17-19). The rapture will take place first (1Thessalonians 4). Then the redeemed armies of heaven will return with the conquering hero, Jesus Christ, who will rule the earth as King of kings and Lord of lords (Revelation 19). And we Christians will reign with him (Rev. 20). What a show that will be!

There will be an awards ceremony as well. All Christians will stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ (2Cor.5:10; Rom.14:10-12). This has nothing to do with their salvation. In Christ there is no condemnation (Rom.8:1). They do not come into judgment as far as their salvation is concerned.

When Christians stand before Christ, they will give an account of the stewardship of their time and talents while on earth. Then they will receive rewards for faithful service (Matt.10:42; Luke56:23; 1Cor.3:14; Eph.6:8; Col.3:24; Heb.11:26; Rev.22:12). We look forward to an awards ceremony unparalleled by anything ever held on earth.

As we anticipate that great final Divine show of power and justice, followed by the Judgment Seat of Christ and the Awards Ceremony, we turn our thoughts to running the race successfully here on earth now. The Apostle Paul shared with the Ephesian elders this heartfelt desire: "I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given to me&mdash;the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace" (Acts 20:24). Paul had before him in his mind the Greek/Roman Games and the sprint. He, too, was running a race, a spiritual race, to cross the finish line as a winner. That race for him was completing his God given assignment to share Jesus Christ with the Gentile world.

The writer to the Hebrews also had such a desire. He wrote, "Let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us" (Hebrews 12:1). Doggedly, this unnamed Christian wanted to train his eye on reaching the goal of a completed race in doing the will of God in his life journey.

The Apostle Paul reached the end of his earthly life. Looking back he assessed his earthly race in this way: "The time has come for my departure. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day&mdash;and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing" (2Tim.4:6-8). Without regret, Paul looked back and then right up to the present moment and said, I have finished the race successfully. I have crossed the finish line. I made it! I will receive the reward of the crown of righteousness. Better than gold!

While we enjoyed the Beijing Olympic Games 2008, there is a Heavenly Olympics approaching. What a grand and final event that will be. The opening show will feature the Lord Jesus Christ returning to earth in glory. The closing event will be the splendor of all Christians finishing their spiritual race successfully and receiving the reward of Christ's approval and the joy of being in the eternal Presence of the Triune God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit&mdash;forever!

I'm closer now to the Heavenly Olympics than I was when I started my Christian race almost 58 years ago. No turning back now. I plan to finish the race successfully&mdash;by God's marvelous grace.

Come join me!
