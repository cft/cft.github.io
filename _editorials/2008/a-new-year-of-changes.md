A New Year has begun. We have just come through the holidays, most of us gasping and glad that it's finally over. So many things to do jam-packed into so little time. Some of us recognized that this last month were holy days and took advantage of the inner peace God desires for us. Most of us, however, got caught up in the frenzy of shopping, baking, decorating, gift exchanges, traveling, family. Too many "have to's" and "shoulds," not enough "want to's" and "did's."

So here we are starting a new year, looking forward to some changes in ourselves, our family, maybe some friends. Right now a little change doesn't sound so bad. After all, change is as dependable as death and taxes. Many of us celebrate the New Year by making those soon-to-be-forgotten New Year's Resolutions.* But who of us ever can keep these self-made-promises all year? If we can't, let's not get disappointed or discouraged if we fail because only God can make any lasting changes that count: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding." (Prov. 3:5)

There are other changes heading our way that we have no control over; and when we have no control, we can become frightened. God knows that we fear what we cannot control. And some of the changes we are going to experience this year have the potential to be terrifying. From Genesis to Revelations, however, God speaks these words 369 times (NIV), "Do not be afraid." We cannot stop the bad things that might happen this year, but we can claim peace through Jesus Christ our Lord whose perfect love casts out all fear (1John 4:18). God did not give us "a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power, love, and of self-discipline." (2Tim. 1:7)

Why don't we welcome in this New Year, not with resolutions we cannot keep, but with confidence in our living God who can make all things possible because He loves us. I'm paraphrasing these words from Beth Moore to state the power in which we can walk this year:

 - God is who He says He is!
 - God can do what He says He can do!
 - I am who God says I am!
 - I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me!
 - God's word is living and active in my heart!

Make a resolution to repeat these words every day of this New Year; and you will find that instead of fearing the changes, you will be focused on how to join God in His work while He goes about making changes that count for eternity.

*Ever wonder where the custom of resolutions began?*

In ancient Babylon resolutions were recorded so that borrowed garden tools would be returned. That makes this custom older than most of our celebrations including Christmas and Easter.
