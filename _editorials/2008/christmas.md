How shall we approach Christmas this year? The whole world is in an economic meltdown. There are still wars going on in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is dire poverty in third world countries - especially in Africa and India. Of course, parts of the world (countries where Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism dominate) do not observe Christmas. In any case, the star over Bethlehem still shines brightly for many. Maybe, just maybe, we can return to a genuine celebration of Christmas this year in spite of the negatives. Hopefully, materialism will not dominate. I have no quarrel with the giving and receiving of gifts as long as this is not the main focus. Christmas at heart is not an economic holiday. Rather it is a time for family and faith.

What about family? We are fortunate when we live near members of our immediate and extended families&mdash;grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, brothers, sister, aunts, uncles, cousins. Did I miss any? With our mobility these days, to live near loved ones is somewhat unusual. If there are one, maybe two close relatives near, that is wonderful. To come together, enjoy a meal, exchange gifts, play a game and read the Holy Scriptures are all very special events.

I realize that there are many who are alone. They have no relatives close. There is nowhere to go, nothing to do. That is sad. We need to keep an eye open for such lonely individuals and, where possible, invite them into our family celebrations.

What about faith? Very important! This is what Christmas is about. Even the loneliest person who has faith is not alone.

Let me explain. Christmas is a Christian celebration that began with the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem some 2,000 years ago. We don't know the exact date of his birth, but long ago December 25th was accepted - at least by the Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths. The Orthodox people celebrate on January 6th. Which date we observe is unimportant. What we celebrate counts.

Why would we celebrate the birth of Jesus? Because of the incarnation. That's a big word that simply means to become flesh. The Son of God (the second person of the Blessed Trinity) came to this earth in the form of a baby boy - truly human and truly divine. This is a mystery that the Bible declares. It is beyond our understanding. Jesus Christ is God with us. This we accept.

This is important because Jesus, The Messiah, came to earth to die on the cross and thereby to redeem our sinful, lost souls. If we receive Jesus into our lives, he saves us from our lostness and gives us the free gift of eternal life. There is nothing we can do to earn this gift. It is all of God's grace and mercy. All we need to do is trust Jesus as the one who saves us from sin and gives us eternal life. Then it is done! No wonder we celebrate Christmas.

I urge you to celebrate Christmas this year in a genuine manner, maybe without loved ones close, but with faith. In that spirit, I wish for you a very Merry Christmas with family and friends, if possible, and always filled with faith in Jesus Christ, who is the reason for the season.
