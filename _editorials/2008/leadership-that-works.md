Leadership is the process of influencing others to accomplish desired objectives. Leadership involves relationships as well as self-development. Different people have said that everything rises or falls on leadership. Why? Because leadership is critical to the life of any organization. Upon reflection of the role of effective leadership, there are important principles that I've learned through personal experience.

 - First, leaders cast the vision for the organization. Jesus modeled this when He talked about the harvest. The greatest gift a leader can give an organization is vision, because vision adds direction and value.
 - Second, leaders create the environment or atmosphere for health and growth. They discern the situations and determine their approach based on a need. Jesus focused on the needs of people and served them.
 - Third, leaders lead the organization. Effective leaders help the organization do better what it is now doing, and do what it is not now doing that it should be doing.

Leadership is an exercise of authority - a position elected or selected; however, it can easily shift into the exercise of power if a leader abuses his/her role. When this happens, Eugene Peterson, author of The Message, says that damage is inflicted on the people being led and the leader.

In observing different leaders, styles, and circumstances, I have discerned there are significant parallels in LIFO, DISC Profile, Temperaments, Smalley's Family Personality Types, and spiritual gifts that contribute to one's effectiveness in leadership. Perhaps you have been introduced to one of these types or styles of leadership. An understanding of one of these styles/types will assist in discerning the situation and determining one's approach.

When considering leadership in the church, care should be taken not to spiritualize secular principles. Some patterns and styles of leadership may assist but should never supersede the spiritual dynamic.

Within the context of the church, leadership is characterized by Scriptural servanthood. When Peter and John were preparing for the Passover feast, they were responsible for every detail; however, they forgot the water and towel&mdash;a very important courtesy in their culture. Peter and John took their places of honor at the table. To their amazement Jesus robed Himself like a household slave and began to wash the disciples' feet (John 13:4-5). He fulfilled a humble assignment and challenged the disciples (and us) to do for others what He modeled.

On another occasion, Jesus said, "You've observed how godless rulers throw their weight around, how quickly a little power goes to their heads. It's not going to be that way with you. Whoever wants to be great must become a servant. Whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave. That is what the Son of Man has done. He came to serve, not be served. &hellip;" (Matt. 20:25-28, The Message)

Leadership that works will make a difference when a leader follows these principles.
