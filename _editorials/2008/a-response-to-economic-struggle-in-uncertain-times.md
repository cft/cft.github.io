Some are saying that we are living in a time of unparalleled economic uncertainty. Predictions of full market recovery are either bleak or very long term. Markets have been reeling, national debt is seemingly unmanageable and the personal impact is quickly being felt by everyone. With government bail-out programs, our economic system may never be the same. However, as Christians, times like these have always been times to express faith, love and hope.

How should we respond to our current condition? As Christians, we have three responses. First, we acknowledge that the recent financial collapse has not been accidental. Greed, corruption and lack of wisdom have all played major roles in this and every fall that is not a natural disaster. As Christians, we pray and confess sin and strive to correct injustice. As Daniel personally confessed and interceded on behalf of the nation (Daniel 9), our confession must be personal and intercessory. As to the matter of communicating justice and responsibility, it is imperative that we, as Christians begin by looking at our own financial practices. We have an ethical responsibility to live in such a way that honors God and our neighbor. We must demonstrate that our security is in God not financial strength. We must strive to live beyond the lure and trap of debt and above questionable investment that jeopardizes our neighbor and society. Our stewardship must be proven especially in difficult times.

Second, as Christians, we are committed to act compassionately toward those suffering economic hardship. [Christians] have historically been committed to ministry to the poor and disenfranchised. These are days of opportunity to express compassion in tangible ways; to demonstrate our love materially and physically for those who have been severely impacted by economic hardship. New ministries should be formed and existing ones sharpened to address the hurt in the communities to which we minister. Ministries of compassion are most helpful when they are most needed. Now is that time.

Third, as Christians, we live in and communicate hope. This is an opportunity to demonstrate that we "do not put [our] hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but&hellip; in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment" (1 Timothy 6:17). It is an opportunity to express the good news that we have "learned to be content, whatever the circumstances" (Philippians 4:11). We must show that we do not live in despair. The good news we proclaim is too often about internal transformation alone. This is a time when our confidence and hope should be expressed through life transformation in spite of our own experience of financial loss. This is a time to show and tell others the good news of our trust and hope in God and invite them to share in our hope.
