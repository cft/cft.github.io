Christians believe that Jesus Christ is very much alive today.

Two thousand years ago he was born of the Virgin Mary, lived on this earth for 33 years, died on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins, after three days in the tomb AROSE FROM THE DEAD, showed himself alive to his followers for 40 days, and then ascended into heaven in full view of his disciples. This is all stated in the historical record, written by reliable, contemporary followers of Jesus - two of them, Matthew and John, members of the original 12 disciples.

Before his departure, Jesus promised he would return to earth in the future and reign for 1,000 years as King of kings and Lord of lords. He will reign in righteousness and justice. No more w more divorce. This is a way of saying, no more sin! You see, sin (breaking God's rules for wholesome living) is what causes a, schools and in families. And we have all sinned. We are all less than we ought to be.

Human sin is why God sent his Son, Jesus, to this earth to live and die for us. If we acknowledge God's view of us as sinners, then put our faith in the death of Jesus on the cross as the full payment for our sins, we become his children. Our sins are forgiven. We embark on a whole new way of life and we have the free gift of eternal life. When we die we go to heaven to be forever with the Triune God - Father, Son and Holy Spirit. What a gift! What a future!

Christians live today in the certain hope that because Jesus rose from the dead, ascended into heaven and is alive today, we too shall live. We do not need to fear death. The Bible teaches, to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

Of course, the future is not so bright for those who refuse to trust Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins and the gift of eternal life. The Bible speaks of a very real hell that awaits those who reject Jesus. I just write that to give a complete picture. But my purpose is to write of things more promising and joyous - the Christian life now and eternity in God's heaven.

Twenty-first Century Christians today still believe the fact of Jesus' resurrection recorded in the Bible. Roman Catholics, Orthodox and Protestant believers rejoice in servicing a living Lord Jesus. In fact, Jesus promised to live inside his followers. Truly born-again believers have the Spirit of Jesus alive in them - in their bodies, their minds and spirits. It is a marvelous thing to be a follower of the Lord. He's alive bodily in heaven. He's alive spiritually in every believer on earth today - over a billion of us.

If you are interested in exploring how you can become a Christian, I invite you to go back to the home page of this website, Christianity For Today (CFT), and click on the tab "Resources." There you will find five steps to discover Jesus as your Savior from sin and the Lord of your life. If you follow those steps, it will change your life now and give you the certain hope of eternal life in heaven with Jesus and millions, if not billions, of Christians.

Christians believe that Jesus is alive today. That's why we have such blessings in this life and such certain hope of life after death.

I invite you to read the record of the Resurrection of Jesus in the four Gospels - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. If you don't own a Bible, check with a book store or a church.

Jesus is alive! He's alive! Get in touch with him today. You will never regret a choice to follow the living Lord Jesus.
