Have you ever thought to yourself, why am I sitting here in church. There has to be a very good reason to go to church week after week. Why am I here?

As a pastor for many years, I tried to help my congregation to understand the main reasons, why it was important for each of them to sit in the pew. It doesn't matter whether the church is traditional or contemporary or something in-between as far as worship-style is concerned. The purpose remains the same. It doesn't matter if the church is Protestant, Roman Catholic, or Eastern Orthodox. The purpose is the same. It doesn't even matter if one is young or old. The purpose of church attendance is important for all.

It seems to me, there are three principle reasons why any of us should attend church:

First, to worship the Triune God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. This is by far the greatest thing we do in a worship service, or at least it should be. He is the only true God. He made us. He redeemed us. He is a constant strength and Presence in our lives. He deserves the adoration and praise of our hearts. (Listen Now: <a href="/library/hymns_to_god.mp3" title="Revelation 4-5 - Hymns to God">Hymns to God</a>)

Second, to fellowship with our Christian friends. This is far more than greeting one another with a smile. It is getting to know each other so that we can rejoice together about the good things we experience and weep together in loving support when we face difficulties. We need each other in good times and bad times. What a joy it is to meet friends in church at least once a week and know that we are valued and loved. (Listen Now: <a href="/library/agree_in_the_lord.mp3" title="Philippians 4:2-9 - Agree in the Lord">Agree in the Lord</a>)

Third, to share the good news of Jesus Christ. There are people all around us, who are not yet Christians. We invite and bring some of them to the services. Others wander in on their own. Regardless of how they get there, they need to see with their eyes and feel with their hearts the love we have for God and for each other. They need to observe the eagerness we have to hear the Word of God preached by the pastor, to sing the hymns and choruses, and to pray for the needs of all humanity. The Holy Spirit creates a hunger in the hearts of non-Christians, who are visiting the services, to experience all of this. They usually have a growing desire to know Jesus Christ personally as we do. (Listen Now: <a href="/library/parable_of_the_heart.mp3" title="Mark 4:1-9, 13-20 - Parable of the Heart">Parable of the Heart</a>)

Ever wonder, why you are sitting in church every Sunday. You are actually serving God by your faithful attendance in the worship hour. You gladden the heart of God with your worship, of your fellow believers with your fellowship, and of non-Christians who are sitting close to you with the glad spirit of your involvement. They see it. They feel it.

I think these three purposes of weekly church attendance are worthy: worship, fellowship and sharing Christ. Never doubt it. You are needed every week in the worship service of your church.
