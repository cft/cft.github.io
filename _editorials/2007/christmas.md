Some years ago I had the privilege of visiting Bethlehem. I went directly to the Church of the Nativity. Descending a flight of stairs I reached a lower level. There the traditional place where Jesus was born is marked with a silver star.

Was this the exact place of his birth? How could I know for sure? I couldn't. However, it really didn't matter to me. I was on a pilgrimage and I was in Bethlehem, the village in which he was born. That much I knew for sure. As I stood before the place marked with a star, I prayed and rejoiced that Jesus had come.

Jesus was called "Emanuel," which means "God with us." Angel choirs announced his birth to rough hewn shepherds out in the fields surrounding Bethlehem. They came and saw the Christ-child. Later Magi from the east also came and worshipped the child. And since that time, I dare say, millions of people have made the trip to Bethlehem just to be in the village where such a wonder took place. The Savior of the world had come. I am glad I could be there once.

I'm reminded of the inspired words of the Apostle Paul, when he wrote in Galatians 4:4-5:

"But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman&mdash;to redeem."

Jesus appeared on the human scene at exactly the right time&mdash;the time of God's choosing. He appeared for one primary purpose: to redeem us from the curse of sin and thereby to give us the free gift of eternal life. Jesus, who is "God with us," later died on the cross to save us from the penalty of sin and make us sons and daughters of the heavenly Father&mdash;children of God.

Recently, I was reading in a devotional book written by the late Pope John Paul II. He was discussing the meaning of the word "Advent," which means "Come." That is the cry of our hearts as Christian believers during every Christmas season: "Come once again, Lord Jesus!" And come he did on that blessed night in Bethlehem. I enjoyed the Pope's description of these events:

"The 'Come' of Advent meets the 'Here I am' of Bethlehem."
Very true!

Jesus is still inviting us to come to him. "Here I am," he says. He is still ready to redeem us from all the darkness of sin and welcome us into his forever family of eternal light and joy.

What about you?

Will you accept his invitation this Christmas Season to eternal life?<br>For an inspirational message about Christmas, Listen Now: <a href="/library/the_promise_of_the_messiah.mp3" title="Special Christmas - The Promise of the Messiah">The Promise of the Messiah</a>.
