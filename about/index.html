      <p>Christianity For Today is an evangelical ministry using the internet to spread the good news of Jesus Christ to the world. Founded in 2005 by multi-generational members of a Christian family in California, the site has grown over the past several years with 639 Bible lessons. The site received several redesigns in 2007 and 2016 to make it easier to navigate.</p>
      <p>Although the founders of Christianity For Today come from three different generations and different professional backgrounds, their mission remains united: To strive to glorify God by teaching His Word in the power of the Holy Spirit so that people may come to know Jesus Christ, grow in their Christian faith, and learn to serve Him in a needy world.</p>
