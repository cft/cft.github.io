Pastor Art is a gifted Bible teacher with over 40 years of missionary and pastoral experience. Having sensed the call to ministry at the age of 14 he soon began preaching the gospel as a young high school student in churches and in the skid row mission.

Following graduation from Bible College in California, Pastor Art went on to seminary in the Pacific Northwest, where he attained a graduate degree. Soon thereafter, he was ordained to the Gospel ministry.

Following his theological education and ordination, Pastor Art served as a missionary to Germany for eight years. He taught in a Bible Institute, in a large Bible study for lay persons, and preached in churches. Having learned the German language, Pastor Art was well received by the students in the institute and by the German people in the various venues. God blessed his ministries in Germany.

Returning to California, Pastor Art became the senior pastor in four evangelical, Bible believing churches in Northern California. Over the 32 years of pastoral work, his teaching and ministry touched thousands of people, young and old alike, in both the Bay Area and in the Central Valley of California. It has been said of Pastor Art, that "he explains the Scriptures in such a way that people can understand, how God's Word applies to their hearts and lives today."

In recent years, Pastor Art has been a guest teaching pastor in a number of churches of various denominations in Northern California. For five years he preached monthly at a large Slavic Baptist Church, where an interpreter translated the biblical teachings into the Russian language for the people. He also served on the NorCal Board of the National Association of Evangelicals and on the Advisory Board for Fuller Seminary Northern California. He mentored Fuller pastoral graduate students and was the volunteer librarian for the Fuller Sacramento library.

He has written seven books in the last few years, ranging from family history, trips through Western Europe and Israel, to a book on the Gospel of John, all of which he has self-published.

Pastor Art is Trinitarian in theology and an evangelical, who holds to the basic truths of the historic Christian Church as taught in the Word of God. He is neither to the left in liberalism, nor to the right in fundamentalism, but squarely in the center of biblical truth and Christian experience. He works inter-denominationally with all evangelical and biblically based people and churches.

Over the years, he has found inspiration and guidance from the biblical writings of British evangelical authors, the evangelistic passion of the Methodists, the expository preaching of the Baptists, and the warm worship of the Charismatics. The mottos of his Bible College, "God First", and seminary, "Armed with the Word; Empowered by the Spirit," have served him well throughout his ministry. He has one supreme purpose: to glorify God in Christ Jesus, and one great mission: to help people to know Jesus personally and to make him Lord of their lives.

Two verses of Scripture have impacted his life in special ways:

In the Old Testament -
<blockquote><p>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go.</p><footer>Joshua 1:9 (NIV)</footer></blockquote>

In the New Testament -
<blockquote><p>I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.</p><footer>Philippians 3:10-11 (NIV)</footer></blockquote>

Pastor Art lives in California. He is widowed and has three adult children, six grandchildren and five great grandchildren. He enjoys reading biography and history, listening to classical music, travel, photography, and writing. He is particularly fond of the California coastline.
