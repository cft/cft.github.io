  excerpt: 'Simon Peter wrote the book of 1st Peter from "Babylon" (the city of Babylon in Mesopotamia? a town in Egypt? or the figurative name for Rome?) around A.D. 60, before or after. A wide range of subjects is covered, all of which are intended to strengthen the church in Northern Asia Minor in the face of a growing persecution. This is not a formal academic lecture (such as Romans) but rather a pastor exhorting his congregation. There is much in this letter that is relevant to Christians in the 21st Century.'
- id: 2nd-peter
  title: 2nd Peter
  excerpt: '2nd Peter was written probably by the Apostle Peter, perhaps from Rome around A.D. 65 to 67. It was written shortly before his death apparently to the same churches he addressed in the first letter - namely the churches of Northern Asia Minor. There is no reference to suffering; therefore the threat of persecution must have disappeared, at least for the moment. There is much admonition to holy living, especially in the light of "the Day of the Lord".'
