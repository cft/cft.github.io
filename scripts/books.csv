"0001","Genesis","The book of Genesis is a book of beginnings - the beginning of the world, of the human race, of a man of faith and a family of faith.  It can easily be divided into the lives of the principal characters of the book:
Adam - Genesis 1-5
Noah - Genesis 6-11
Abraham - Genesis 12-25
Isaac - Genesis 26
Jacob - Genesis 27-36
Joseph - Genesis 37-50
Genesis is above all the beginning of God's self-revelation.  God reveals both his power and character through his names.  It is also the beginning of the revelation of God's plan of salvation for a lost human race.

"0002","Exodus","The name ""Exodus"" is a Latin word taken from the Greek ""Exodos"", which was the name the translators gave the book when they translated the Hebrew version into the Greek Old Testament known as the Septuagint (LXX).  This name was retained by the Latin Vulgate and found its way into the English as well.  The word means ""departure"" and refers to the main event of the book, if not the Old Testament, namely the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egyptian bondage.  The first five books of the Bible are known as the Pentateuch, namely Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.  They are also commonly called ""the five books of Moses"".
The key people in Exodus are the Hebrews, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who had now spent over 400 years in Egypt.  The key person is Moses, who is commonly held to be the author of the Pentateuch.
Moses' life can easily be divided into three time periods - all contained in the book of Exodus:
Moses' birth and life in Egypt 40 years  Exodus 1 - 4a
Moses' life in the Sinai Desert 40 years  Exodus 4b - 12
Moses' leadership of Israel    40 years  Exodus 13 - 40
Obviously, the majority of the book is covered by chapters 13 - 40.  These chapters include a time period of ca. 40 years.  But, most of the activity of chapters 13 - 40 covers only about two years.  The other 38 years were spent in the wilderness wanderings.  Those wanderings are covered mainly in the book of Numbers.
The book of Leviticus is a manual, covering the offerings of the Tabernacle worship, the priests and other laws.
Deuteronomy is a recap of the books of the Pentateuch exclusive of Genesis. It also records the passing of Moses.

"0004","Numbers","The book of Numbers comes from the Septuagint (LXX) and is named for the census lists found in chapters 1 and 26.  The Hebrew title of this book is ""bemidbar"" and means ""in the desert"", which covers the content of the book more accurately.  This is the record of the ca. 40 year wilderness wanderings of Israel before they entered the Promised Land.

"0006","Joshua","Joshua is a record of the conquest of the Promised Land.  After some 400 years of bondage in Egypt and now 40 years in the wilderness, Joshua and the people entered the land promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  They first had to overcome the kings of Canaan before they could distribute the land to the 12 tribes of Israel.

"0007","Judges","Judges tells of the leaders of Israel between Joshua and the beginning of the monarchy, a period of three to four hundred years.  There is a recurring cycle at this time in the life of Israel: sin, domination by a foreign power, repentance on the part of Israel, and finally, God raises up a judge who delivers Israel from foreign domination.  A time of peace and prosperity followed before the cycle was repeated all over again - apostasy, oppression, repentance, deliverance. It happened at least seven times.
There were at least 14 judges, with six major judges:  Othniel, Ehud, Deborah, Gideon, Jephthah and Samson.
This period in the life of Israel is characterized by unfaithfulness to God and general spiritual decline.  It is described in the last verse of the book: ""In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit."" (Judges 21:25)

"0008","Ruth","Ruth is a short love story of four chapters.  It is a bright spot in the otherwise dark period of the Judges.  In the story, God brings together Ruth of Moab and Boaz of Israel.  Of great significance is the fact that Boaz and Ruth are in the genealogy of King David and of the Messiah, Jesus Christ (Matthew 1:5-6 and Luke3:32).

"0009","1st Samuel","First and Second Samuel are named after the man, Samuel, who transitioned Israel from the rule of the judges to the monarchy.  Samuel anointed both Saul and David as the first two successive kings of Israel.
First Samuel can be outlined in this manner:
Samuel's birth, youth and calling     1 Samuel 1-7
The establishment of the kingship   1 Samuel 8-12
The failure of Saul's kingship      1 Samuel 13-15
David's rise to power        1 Samuel 16-31
The lessons below concern themselves primarily with the life of David before he became king.

"0010","2nd Samuel","Second Samuel is all about David's kingship and family.  He ruled seven years over Judah and thirty-three years over the United Kingdom of the south (Judah) and the north (Israel) for a total of 40 years.  During this reign there were highs and lows.  But through it all David showed, that in spite of his imperfections, he had a heart for God.
Second Samuel can be outlined in the following manner:
David becomes king over Judah        2 Samuel 1-4
David becomes king over all Israel      2 Samuel 5:1-5
David conquers Jerusalem      2 Samuel 5:6-25

"0011","1st Kings","The book of First Kings covers the very end of the Davidic reign, the reign of his son Solomon over the United Kingdom, the building of the Temple, and after Solomon's death, the division of the kingdom into two parts - Israel in the north and Judah in the south.  
In the Hebrew Old Testament the books of First and Second Kings are one book.  The Septuagint (LXX, the Greek translation of the Old Testament) translators of the Hebrew Old Testament divided the book.
Because of sin, namely idolatry, both kingdoms were eventually carried away into captivity - first the northern Kingdom of Israel (by the Assyria in 722 B.C.) and second the southern Kingdom of Judah by Babylonia in 586 B.C.  
But God did not punish his people quickly.  In much patience and mercy he sent prophets to both kingdoms in an attempt to get the kings and the people to repent.  All the kings of the northern kingdom were evil.  Some of the kings of the southern kingdom were good but many were bad.  In the end, God had to punish both the north and the south.
First Kings records the ministry of the great prophet Elijah to the northern kingdom of Israel.  The four lessons below report on this ministry.

","1st Kings"
"0012","2nd Kings","The book of Second Kings covers the last 130 years of the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the last 250 years of the Southern Kingdom of Judah.  It records the translation of the prophet Elijah into heaven in a fiery chariot and the subsequent ministry of his successor, Elisha.  The prophet Elisha ministered to Israel, Judah and even to foreign countries.
""The LORD warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers: 'Turn from your evil ways.  Observe my commands and decrees, in accordance with the entire Law that I commanded your fathers to obey and that I delivered to you through my servants the prophets.' But they would not listenâ€¦they rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their fathers and the warnings he had given them.  They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless."" (2Kings 17:13-15).  And so God gave them over to captivity by the world powers at the time.
The captivity of Israel by the Assyrian Empire in 722 B.C. is noted (17:23).  The captivity of Judah by the Babylonian Empire in 586 B.C. is also described with the destruction of Jerusalem, her walls and the Temple (25:21).
Second Kings records the end of Elijah's ministry and the ministry of the great prophet Elisha.  The record of Elisha's death (from natural causes) is found in 2Kings 13:20.

"0015","Nehemiah","The Old Testament books of Ezra and Nehemiah go together.  They tell the story of Israel's return to the Land of Promise from the exile in Babylon.
These books represent two periods in Israel's restoration to the land at the end of the exile: first, the rebuilding of the temple and the re-establishment of Israel's spiritual life (538-516 B.C./Ezra 1-10); then the rebuilding of the wall around Jerusalem (458-420 B.C./Nehemiah 1-13).  Ezra, the priest, returned first (see the book of Ezra), followed later by Nehemiah, a high ranking official in the service of Artaxerxes, King of Babylon.
Nehemiah is an exciting book that tells of the faithfulness of ""Yahweh"" (The LORD), the Elohim (God) of Israel.  It also records the obedience of a layman, Nehemiah, in the service of the purposes of God.  Without question, God is sovereign over Israel and the nations of this world.

"0021","Esther","The book of Esther is unique in the Old Testament in that it does not once mention the names of God (Yahweh or Elohim).  And yet it is highly esteemed among the Jewish people.
The events of the book transpire during the reign of King Xerxes of Persia (present day Iran).  The issue was the survival of the Jewish people in Persia.  The providence of God is overall evident as a Jewish young woman, Esther, finds herself in a position to save the Jews of Persia from genocide.

"0023","Psalms","The writers of the psalms express a wide range of feelings and experiences, from depression to joy. These experiences are based on particular circumstances in the days of the Psalmist, yet they are applicable to our daily lives today in the 21st century. The modern age is not unique--we feel the same emotions and are often confounded by the same kinds of issues and problems in life.  Whether we cry out in need, or extend worship, it is to the same God today as in the days of the Psalmist.  
The Psalms are a collection of Old Testament hymns grouped according to common themes, common purpose, or a common author. It is difficult for scholars to precisely date individual psalms, or to discover just how and when they were collected and compiled.  We do know that Moses wrote one.  Probably David is the most popular writer of the Psalms.  The process continued into the days after the Hebrew exile. According to early manuscripts of the Psalms found at Qumran in Israel, it is believed that the whole collection of Psalms as we have them today must have been finalized sometime before the Maccabean period around the second century before Christ.
The late C.S. Lewis, noted author and scholar, commented on the Psalms as follows: ""The Psalms are poems, and poems intended to be sung: not doctrinal treatises, nor even sermons ...They must be read as poems if they are to be understood ...otherwise we shall miss what is in them and think we see what is not.""
Of the 150 Psalms written, Pastor Art teaches from 30 and delivers pertinent and heartfelt messages that make it not only easy to identify with the Psalmists of old, but also to apply the principles of these scriptural hymns to living in the modern age.","The Psalms"
"0024","Isaiah","The book of Isaiah has been called by some ""The Fifth Gospel"" because it has so much to say about the Messiah.  The New Testament identifies Jesus as the Messiah that Isaiah foretold.
The book, written most likely by one author, seems to divide into two parts:  chapters 1-39 (the failure of humankind) and chapters 40-66 (the hope of the Messiah).  Of all the books of the Old Testament, Isaiah is the most quoted in the New Testament.
In the eighth century B.C. Elijah and Elisha were the most prominent non-writing prophets.  Isaiah, a writing prophet, began the eight century B.C. followed by many others.  There are five Major Prophets (those who wrote longer books) and 12 Minor Prophets (those who wrote shorter books).  All the prophets are important regardless of the length of their books.  They wrote mainly to the divided kingdom, Israel in the north and Judah in the south, prior to their going into captivity (Israel to Assyria in 722 B.C and Judah to Babylon in 586 B.C.)  Some of the later prophets wrote to the Jews returning to Jerusalem after the captivity.
The lessons below cover a portion of Isaiah's message.

"0025","Ezekiel","The writer of this book is Ezekiel, the prophet-priest of the Babylonian exile.  He was exiled along with 10,000 Jews from Judea to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar in 597 B.C.  In 586 B.C. there was a final siege on Jerusalem by the Babylonians, at which time the city and the Temple were burned.
Ezekiel wrote this prophesy from Babylonia, preceding the destruction of Jerusalem by 7 years and following it by 15 years.  These 22 years of his prophetic activity exceeded a priest's normal service by two years.  (Priests served from age 30 to age 50, after which they entered semi-retirement and assisted others in ministry.)
The book of Ezekiel can be outlined in the following way:
Jerusalem and the Temple will fall - Chapters.1 to 24  
Seven surrounding nations will be judged - Chapters. 25 to 32   
A word of hope given for God's people -  Chapters. 33 to 48  
The prophecy of Ezekiel proclaims God's sovereignty over creation, people, nations and the course of history.

"0026","Daniel","Daniel was a prophet of the late Babylonian exile period.  The book is of the apocalyptic genre' in the same class as Ezekiel, Zechariah and Revelation.  The period is during that of the successive world powers of Babylonia, the Medes and the Persians and Persia. The inspired author of the book is not known.  However, it may well have been the prophet, Daniel, himself.  
Half of the book, chapters 1-6, is about the Israelite and government official, Daniel, and his friends.  It shows them faithfully serving the one true God-Yahweh, the God (Elohim) of Israel.  They were faithful to God at the risk of their lives.
The second half of the book, chapters 7-12, gives us the dreams/visions of the Prophet Daniel.  These dreams/visions range from easy to understand to very difficult, if not impossible, to understand.  One thing is clear.  God Almighty is in ultimate control of human history from the time of Daniel to the end times and the final establishment of the Kingdom of God.

"0027","Hosea","There are 12 Minor Prophets in the Old Testament: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi.  The five Major Prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel and Daniel.  The ""major"" and ""minor"" designations have nothing to do with the importance of the prophecy.  All the prophets, major and minor, are important.  These designations have to do with the length of the prophecy or book.  The Major Prophets are longer and the Minor Prophets are shorter in length.
Of these 12 Minor Prophets, the first nine are pre-exilic (preceding the Assyrian exile in 722 B.C. and/or Babylonian exile in 586 B.C.) and three are post-exilic (during the time of the Jewish return from Babylon to Jerusalem).

"0090","Matthew","The Gospel of Matthew is the life story of Jesus - his birth, teachings, miracles, death and resurrection.
The book of Matthew was written by the disciple, Matthew, according to early church writers. It may have been the first gospel to appear.  It was most likely written some time between A.D.50 and A.D.70.
It shares many verses with both Mark and Luke and therefore is called a ""synoptic"" (like) gospel.  There was possible a ""Q"" document that all the gospel writers drew from with the exception of John.  Or, it is possible that the other synoptics drew from Matthew, or they all drew from Mark, if indeed Mark was the first gospel.  We know that Luke wrote his gospel later than Matthew and Mark.  John was the last gospel written.  
Matthew was written primarily for Jews and therefore stresses Old Testament Scripture and the theme of Jesus Christ, the Messiah.  Matthew uses ""Kingdom of Heaven"" instead of ""Kingdom of God"", which respected the Jewish hesitation to use the holy name of God.  
There are five major discourses of Jesus given in this gospel: Sermon on the Mount (Chapters 5-7); Sending of the Twelve (Chapter 10); The Parables (Chapter 13); Principles of the Kingdom (Chapter 18); and Prophecy (Chapters 24-25).","The Gospel of Matthew"
"0100","Mark","The Gospel of Mark is an action packed narrative of Jesus' activities while on planet Earth.  The gospel recounts the places Jesus visited, his teachings, his time with his disciples, and the miracles he performed out among the people.  Perhaps the first and the shortest of the four gospels, the author tells the good news of Jesus in 16 chapters recounting events chronologically as they occurred.  Starting with the baptism of Jesus and leading to the defining moments in His life such as the crucifixion and His resurrection the story is told.  
Biblical scholars and historians maintain that the Gospel of Mark was written by John Mark, an understudy of the Apostle Peter, in approximately AD 65-70--perhaps the first gospel to be written.  It is noted that the author pays careful attention to explain Jewish customs, which many believe indicates that the primary audience for this gospel may well have been non-Jewish readers such as the Romans.  
The Gospel of Mark depicts Jesus in action.  The word ""immediately"" appears often in the text.  Although the book is a fast-paced look at Jesus' life, Pastor Art takes time to focus in on critical passages that bring out nuggets of biblical truth for believers to apply to their lives today.  The twenty-five lessons expose present day believers to Jesus' approach to key issues of His times and take-away principles that can be applied to life today.","The Gospel of Mark"
"0150","Luke","The Gospel of Luke was written by Luke, the beloved physician (Colossians 4:14).  He was not one of the original 12 disciples of Jesus, but nevertheless came upon the Christian scene quite early.  He was also apparently not a Jew by ethnicity, but rather a gentile.  In fact he is the only non-Jew to write a book of the New Testament.  Furthermore, Luke is the only gospel writer to produce a sequence to his gospel, namely the Acts of the Apostles. 
Luke wrote the gospel bearing his name taking a scientific approach.  This was quite natural for him as a trained physician.  Not being an eyewitness to the things whereof he wrote, he interviewed reliable people.  He ""investigated everything carefully"" and produced ""an orderly account"" of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.  It was different with the book of Acts.  Luke became a co-worker with the Apostle Paul during his second and third missionary journeys and thus an eyewitness to the expansion of the early church as evidenced by the ""we sections&#148 (beginning with Acts 16:10 ff). 
The book of Luke itself is divided in the following way by Leon Morris in his Tyndale NT Commentary:
Preface                                             1:1-4
Infancy narratives                              1:5-22
Ministry of John the Baptist              3:1-20
Beginning of Jesus' ministry            3:21-4:13
Jesus in Galilee                                 4:14-9:50
From Galilee to Jerusalem              9:51-19:44
Jesus in Jerusalem                           9:45-21:38
Crucifixion                                          22:1-23:56
Resurrection                                      24:1-53
Luke, along with Matthew and Mark are called synoptic gospels, meaning ""same gospels"".  That means, many of the verses are exactly the same in all three books.  This suggests a common source (""Q"" for the German word Quella meaning ""source"").  Of course, there are many differences as well in what is or is not included.  A clear feature of Luke is his emphasis on the Holy Spirit.  One senses as one reads this gospel that there is a deep spirituality. ","The Gospel of Luke"
"0200","John","The Gospel of John is a record primarily of what Jesus said, especially claims He made about himself.  The style of the writer is different than Mathew's Gospel which records Jesus' sayings.  The author of John, who refers to himself simply as &#145;the disciple whom Jesus loved&#146; (21 :20, 24), assumes that the readers already know the facts about Jesus' life. He writes to bring out the meaning of the events that take place by focusing on the miracles (seven &#145;signs&#146;) which show most clearly who He was--the God-Man. The main aim of the author is to bring the reader to a personal faith in Jesus as Savior and Lord (20:30-31).
Unlike Mathew, there are no parables in John. Most of the events recorded take place in and around Jerusalem at the various festivals where Jesus utilized a teaching method that was appropriate for the business, political and theological climate of the region.
The Gospel of John was the last of the four gospels to be written. Scholars believe it was probably written around AD 90. The early church taught that the aged Apostle John wrote or dictated this &#145;spiritual&#146; Gospel from Ephesus located in present-day Turkey.
Pastor Art teaches from each of the 21 chapters of the Gospel of John and explains in modern-day terms the timeless focus of John's Gospel--namely, Jesus is the promised Messiah and the Son of God.","The Gospel of John"
"0300","Acts","Acts chronicles the history of the early Christian Church from its inception on the Day of Pentecost in Jerusalem (Acts 2) through the Apostle Paul's imprisonment in Rome (Acts 28). The book's author describes the spread of Christianity from Jerusalem westward over a thirty-year period around the northern Mediterranean area through present-day Syria, Turkey, Greece, and on to Rome.  The &#145;acts&#146; or evangelistic activities referenced in the writings are related mainly to those of the apostles Peter and Paul. 
Most scholars believe that Paul's friend Luke, &#145;the physician&#146;, wrote Acts as a sequel to his earlier work, namely the Gospel of Luke.  Luke, the only non-Jewish writer in the New Testament, uses a style of writing punctuated with facts, eye witness accounts, and reliable historical references. Because Luke was present at many of the events he describes in Acts he provides an impassioned view into the life of the world's first missionaries who carried the good news of Christ into the known world.  Luke was with Paul at Philippi; he accompanied him on the fateful journey to Jerusalem, stuck by him during the two years of incarceration at Caesarea, and shared the voyage and shipwreck on the way to Rome. Luke was able to obtain additional information first-hand from Paul and Barnabas, others in the church at Antioch and Jerusalem, and from James, Jesus' brother. 
The Book of Acts was written in order to give the Roman, Theophilus, as well as other Gentiles, an accurate record of the true facts about Christianity (Luke 1:1-4). During the time period in which Acts was written (AD 60-63), numerous strange and distorted rumors were spreading among Gentiles concerning Christianity.  Luke's writings work to clear up misconceptions and to lead people to faith in Christ.
The pages of Acts depict how the work of the Holy Spirit in the early church helped guide and direct the expansion of the Christian movement in its early years.  The spread of the good news continues to this day.  Many of the challenges faced by first century Christians are the same as those faced in the twenty-first century.  In 16 lessons, Pastor Art unfolds key truths contained in the 28 chapters of Acts and applies them to the Church of today. ","The Book of Acts"
"0350","Romans","The letter to the Romans was written by the Apostle Paul, the converted Jew and Roman citizen, about AD 57.  Having undertaken three missionary trips, where he had pioneered the Christian message throughout much of the Roman Empire, Paul had not yet visited Rome.  Paul felt a call to expand his missionary endeavors further westward.  As he planned it, while heading in the direction of Spain, he would finally fulfill the ambition of years and visit the Christians in Rome.  
As Paul wrote this letter, Rome was the capital of an empire which stretched from Britain in the west to Arabia in the east.  The empire was the center of the world's wealth, culture and trade.  Due to the effectiveness of the Gospel and the ease of travel, a growing Christian community made up of Jews and Gentiles was forming in Rome. 
What compelled him to write this unique document at this time in his ministry was perhaps a sense that he might never make it to Rome.  Therefore, he chose to write it down for the Roman Christians in the event he did not personally arrive in Rome.  
Without a doubt, this letter is Paul's gospel manifesto.  The theme of Paul's letter is that faith in Christ is the only way people can gain acceptance by God, regardless of religious background and practice. 
Paul sees the world as it really is, i.e., not as rosy as secular thought might lead one to believe (Chapter 1).  
He proclaims that regardless of social status, or religious pedigree, every single person is guilty of violating God's standards and as a result stands condemned before a righteous God. Even the practicing Jews, who had the unique privilege of knowing God's law for centuries, cannot keep it well enough to avoid the guilty sentence (Chapter 2-3). 
Nevertheless, Paul does not leave the reader without hope.  He reveals that God offers a free pardon, a clean slate and new life to all who will believe the ""good news"" of Jesus Christ. He explains that Jesus, the Son of God, has served our sentence for us on the cross (Chapter 4-5).
Paul further writes that the Lord Jesus breaks the chains of our slavery to sin.  Paul proclaims that new-born Christians are free to make a fresh new start--this time with all the power of God at their disposal for clean living (Chapters 6-8).
After speaking of his anguish over the nation of Israel (Chapters 9-11), Paul ends his writing by giving very practical directions for Christian living (Chapters 12-16). 
Paul's letter to the Romans reached them three years before he would.  In the providence of God, Paul's letter made an impact before he ultimately reached Rome as a prisoner for Christ (Acts 28).  
In the tradition of religious theologians such as Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Bunyan and Wesley, Pastor Art's Christianity For Today messages bring contemporary life applications for Christians out of Paul's letter to the Romans.  In 10 Bible-based lessons Pastor Art discusses God's forgiveness and love and shares how they provide the basis for living the new life on a higher plane, reshaping our way of thinking and acting.  
This series offers the opportunity for you to listen and learn what it means to live life in a manner worthy of our new calling as Christians.","The Book of Romans"
"0400","1st Corinthians","The book of First Corinthians was authored by the Apostle Paul (1Cor.1:1).  The letter was written about A.D. 55 toward the end of Paul&#039s three year ministry in Ephesus (1Cor.16:8).
The story of the successful founding of the Corinthian Church by Paul is found in Acts 18.  Paul spent a year and a half in this ministry at Corinth.
In Paul&#039s time, the city of Corinth is estimated to have had 250,000 free citizens and an additional 400,000 slaves.  Thus the total population approximated 650,000 people.  Corinth was a large city.
The worship of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, was a main feature of Corinthian religious life.  This worship advocated prostitution in the name of religion.  Is it any wonder that the people saved out of such an evil culture had problems in their young church?
Paul received information about several difficult issues that had arisen in this church since his departure.  Thus he wrote First Corinthians to guide this young church in matters of Christian conduct.  
The following topics are addressed:  Disunity in the fellowship, immorality in the church, lawsuits among the members, marriage or singleness, food sacrificed to idols, personal rights, the Lord&#039s Supper, spiritual gifts, Divine love, the practice of tongues, and the resurrection of the dead.","1st Corinthians"
"0450","2nd Corinthians","The book of Second Corinthians was most likely also written in A.D. 55, but from Macedonia (2Cor 2:13; 7:5).  Paul is the author (2Cor.1:1).  This letter is intensely personal and contains more autobiographical material than any of his other writings.
Paul had indicated that he planned to visit Corinth again (1Cor. 16:5-7).  However, he had a change in plans, at least, in timing.  This caused some in the Corinthian Church to accuse Paul of deceiving them (saying ""yes, I'm coming"", but really meaning &#147no, I'm not coming&#148).  It was alleged, Paul's word could not be trusted. In fact, false teachers had arisen in the Corinthian Church, who were stirring things up by saying that Paul was not a true apostle and that he could not be trusted with the church money collected for the famine stricken Christians of Jerusalem.  Furthermore, these false teachers claimed they had a better gospel.  Paul answers his critics in a tender but firm way.  His personal life was above reproach, his teaching was true and he was still coming to Corinth.
This second epistle can easily be divided into three main sections:  the reason for the change in plans (chs.1-7); the collection of money for the needy in Jerusalem (chs. 8-9); the authenticity of Paul's apostleship (chs. 10-13).
While the Book of Acts tells of Paul's physical sufferings for Christ, the second letter to the Corinthians gives us an insight into the spiritual and emotional sufferings of Paul - and of any true minister of Jesus Christ.","2nd Corinthians"
"0500","Galatians","The book of Galatians was written by the Apostle Paul, a converted Jew, to Gentile Christians living in the large Roman Province of Galatia, which extended  throughout much of present day north-central Turkey. It is not only the first book Paul wrote, it is also, along with the book of  James, one of the earliest books (ca. AD 47) of the entire New Testament-maybe even ahead of the gospels! 
Church historians know from passages in Acts 13 and 14 that Paul founded churches in the ancient cities of Antioch, Iconium, Lystera and Derbe during his first missionary trip-all part of southern Galatia.  
This was his great freedom declaration-freedom in Christ from the Jewish ceremonial law and, more importantly, freedom from a life of sin. However, not long after Paul's initial visit, other Jews began arriving in Galatia with a modified gospel-plus message for these new Christians.  Paul, having taught the early Galatian Christians that all that was needed for salvation was God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ, soon found that the Gentiles in Galatia were being confused and misguided with the requirements that Gentile Christian converts also must adhere to traditional Jewish customs in order to gain true salvation.  This was wrong and intolerable for the great apostle.   
The general purpose of the book is to reinforce salvation by God's grace alone, through faith in the work of Christ on the cross. This singular gospel (or ""good news"") was preached to Gentiles and Jews alike by Paul from day-one of his own conversion through the end of his ministry.  To refute the nonsense of works-based faith, Paul presents strong arguments to the Galatian churches.  His central point is:  There is no need to add any requirements to the grace of God in Christ!  His arguments refute the erroneous position that Gentiles are required to take on additional Jewish requirements for keeping the Christian faith, such as the rite of circumcision (Chapter 5:2), the observance of Jewish festivals (Chapter 4:10), and quite possibly Jewish food laws.
Paul's style of writing in this Galatian epistle has a strong sense of urgency as he reacts quite forcefully under the inspiration and guidance of the Holy Spirit.  His goal in writing was quite simply to get early Galatian Christians back on track spiritually.  Paul supports the truth of salvation by grace through faith with lessons from history (Chapters 1-2), tutorials from theology (Chapters 3-4), and with illustrations from experience (Chapters 5-6).  
Paul's first century message is echoed by Pastor Art in the 21st century.  Jesus really does make a difference in the life of a Christian.  No amount of additional religious rule-keeping serves to elevate the Christian closer to God.  In surveying Paul's teachings, Pastor Art uncovers the basic truths that allow modern day Christians to live in Christian freedom and holiness.  Pastor Art's biblical lessons begin with an exploration of Paul's personal testimony, move next to Paul's doctrinal teachings, and finish with practical applications of the Scripture to modern day life.","The Book of Galatians"
"0550","Ephesians","By way of his missionary journeys Paul spent extended time in the province of Asia in Ephesus and other cities.  He established friendships with many there.  Interestingly, Paul's letter to the Ephesians has none of his usual personal greetings and does not deal with any particular problems or news.  Therefore, most Bible scholars believe that the Book of Ephesians began as a circular letter written by Paul to a group of churches in what is now western Turkey.  
The church at Ephesus was one of the churches in the area as were the churches at Colossae and Laodicia.  Many Bible scholars believe that Paul wrote this letter probably from prison (house arrest/Acts 28:3-31) in Rome in the years around A.D. 60.  Other letters written during the same period are Philippians, Colossians and Philemon. 
The general nature of the letter provides few clues to the situation in the church at Ephesus, with the exception that there is a general theme that urges the churches of Gentile Christians to unite with their fellow Jewish Christians in common faith. Although Paul had been specially called by the Lord to work among the Gentiles (Acts 9:15), the theme in this letter focuses around God's glorious plan to bring men and women of every nation and background together in Christ (Eph. 1:10; 2:14-19).
The letter itself is generally divided into two parts:  Chapters 1-3/theological; Chapters 4-6/practical.  The first three theological chapters are perhaps the most profound writing of the apostle on the theme of salvation.
In 12 Bible messages Pastor Art explores Paul's letter to the Ephesians and brings out key messages that emphasize that as Christians, all are on equal terms. Pastor Art also focuses a number of messages on what it means to be an authentic follower of Christ through family relationships.  The final message in the series, The Believer's Battle Dress, cautions Christians that the Devil is alive and on the prowl.  However, with the power of God it is possible to successfully live the Christian life in the face of an enemy who desperately wants to defeat Christians.
Your Christian life will definitely be enriched by the inspired writing of the Apostle Paul called Ephesians.","The Book of Ephesians"
"0560","Philippians","The book of Philippians is one of four Prison Epistles (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon), written by the Apostle Paul while he was in prison for his Christian faith.  The place of writing was either Caesarea (Acts 24:27) or Rome (Acts 28:30).  He spent two years in prison in each location and would have had opportunity to write these letters.  Probably he wrote this letter from Rome about A.D.61.
Paul penned this epistle to the church at Philippi (Acts 16), a church that he dearly loved.  In spite of the unfavorable conditions under which he wrote, it is a delightful piece of work in four chapters, written mostly in a positive tone.  Notable is the fact that the word ""joy"" appears 16 times in its various forms.  There are also many warnings about the perils that face any church - then or now.
The most profound statement on the meaning of the incarnation is found in Philippians 2:5-11.  This is one of those special, don't-miss teaching paragraphs.  Also, at the end of the book there is a special section on Paul's attitude toward the material things of life.  Again, a don't-miss paragraph.","The Book of Philippians"
"0600","Colossians","The book of Colossians is one of four ""Prison Epistles"" (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon) written by the Apostle Paul about A.D. 60 - 61.  The village of Colosse was a Roman city in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) at the base of the 8,000 foot Mt. Cadmus in the Lycus River valley 100 miles east of Ephesus.  Actually, there were three small towns in this valley:  Colosse, Laodicaea and Hierapolis.  All three are mentioned in this letter.  Interestingly, Paul never personally visited this valley as far as we know (2:1).
The church at Colosse may have been started by Epaphras, one of Paul's close co-workers.  Epaphras was from Colosse (4:12) and cared deeply about this church.
This short letter has great sections on the deity of Jesus Christ (1:15,19), his active participation in the creation of the world (1:16) and the fullness of understanding in him (2:2).  Colossians is a great Christological book.  Also, rules for family life in Paul's times are found in the third chapter.  All-in-all, Colossians is rich in Christian doctrine and directions for practical Christian living.","The Book of Colossians"
"0650","1st Thessalonians","The Apostle Paul ministered in the city of Thessalonica (present day northern Greece) during his second missionary journey and following his ministry at Philippi.  The record of Paul's ministry in Thessalonica is found in Acts 17:1-10.  His ministry was in the Jewish synagogue.  The message was that Jesus is the Messiah, who had to suffer and rise from the dead.  Some Jewish and Gentiles were converted.  However, other Jews resisted and started a riot against Paul in the city.  False charges were leveled at Paul and his companions before the city officials.  This necessitated the exodus of Paul from Thessalonica.
The two Thessalonian letters, along with the Galatian letter, are probably the earliest that Paul wrote-around A.D. 51.  In addition to general instructions on survival in the midst of persecution and on godly living, Paul wrote them about the coming of Christ.  This is the only place in the New Testament where ""the rapture"" is indicated.  It is also the first apostolic writing on ""the coming"" or the ""parousia"" of Jesus.
First Thessalonians is truly a helpful letter for the Christian believer.","1st Thessalonians"
"0700","2nd Thessalonians","The second letter to the Thessalonians was written by Paul about the same time as the first letter - A.D. 51.  In it the apostle continues to thank God for these Christians and to assure them of his prayers.  
As he spoke about the coming of Christ, ""parousia"", which is ""the rapture"", in the first letter, here he speaks of the revealing of Christ, ""apokalupsis"", which is the second coming of Christ on ""the Day of the Lord"" as found in Revelation 19.  Paul taught the coming of the Lord to this young church.  In fact, nowhere else in the Pauline corpus are these teachings found.  They are truly unique to the Thessalonian correspondence.  Otherwise, general instruction on godly living is offered.","2nd Thessalonians"
"0780","1st Timothy","1st Timothy is one of three ""pastoral epistles"", namely 1st Timothy, 2nd Timothy and Titus.  These books were written by the missionary-evangelist, Paul, to his younger proteges, Timothy, who was pastoring the Ephesian church, and Titus, who was pastoring the church on the island of Crete.  This book was probably written about A.D 60.
Timothy was a younger man, whom Paul met during his second missionary journey.  Timothy joined the evangelistic team and traveled with Paul.  Later Paul sent him to Ephesus to pastor this promising church.
Paul instructs Timothy, his ""true son in the faith"", on certain basic issues of early church life.  In contrast to 2nd Timothy, this first letter is all about church order in the local assembly of believers.  It is relevant to churches in the 21st Century.","1st Timothy"
"0790","2nd Timothy","This letter was Paul's last.  He is once again a prisoner for Christ - this time facing death.  It is an intensely personal epistle written from the heart of the old warrior, Paul, to the younger minister, Timothy.  Paul opens his heart as he reflects on his own ministry and on that of Timothy.  It is a challenge that any minister or layperson can read with great profit.","2nd Timothy"
"0800","Titus","The Book of Titus is one of three ""pastoral letters"" in the New Testament: 
1 & 2 Timothy and Titus.  The writer identifies himself as Paul (Titus 1:1).  He writes to ""Titus, my true son"", (Titus 1:4).  The letter was most likely written soon after Paul's release from house arrest in Rome ca. A.D 62 or 63 (Acts 28).   
Paul sent Titus to the Island of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea located just below both present day Greece and Turkey to give spiritual direction to a troubled church.  There were false teachers in this church that needed to be dealt with.  As the mentor of Titus, Paul gave instructions both theological and practical to guide the leadership of Titus in this sensitive mission. Those instructions are valid for our times as well.","Titus"
"0850","Philemon","Philemon is a private letter written by the Apostle Paul from his Roman imprisonment to Philemon, one of his converts and a good friend who lived in Colossae, located in present-day Turkey.  A group of local Christians regularly met in Philemon's home as the Church in Colossae.  Philemon, being of some standing in the society of his time, had slaves.  One of them, Onesimus, had apparently stolen a significant amount of money and run away to Rome where he could easily escape detection.   It is there that Onesimus came into contact with the imprisoned Apostle Paul and became a Christian.  From the letter it is evident that the Apostle Paul not only loved and held Philemon in high regard, but he also loved the young slave Onesimus like a son.
After Onesimus' conversion the problem was that he remained Philemon's legal property. The crimes that Onesimus committed carried with them punishment. Although the Apostle Paul enjoyed Onesimus' company, he could not keep him there in Rome without Philemon's willing consent. So he wrote the letter of Philemon as a ""covering note"" for Onesimus and sent him back to Philemon to make amends.  Paul's intention in writing was to ask Philemon to be lenient with the run-away slave. The Apostle took care in explaining the conversion of Onesimus, who was returning to his master as a very different man. He was not just a slave now, but a brother-Christian and the Apostle wanted wanted Philemon to welcome him as such.
This letter is loving, tactful, considerate, and full of warm praise. Paul knows Philemon - his faith and Christian love.  From verses 15 and 16 it is not clear whether Paul has any thought of Onesimus being set free. Slavery was such an integral part of the social structure of the day - the ancient Roman empire had over 60 million slaves in those days - that to preach freedom would have been tantamount to revolution. Paul's brief was not to engage in political campaigning, but preach a gospel capable of transforming human life from within.
Bible scholars believe that the Apostle Paul's friend Tychicus accompanied Onesimus back to Philemon's household to keep him company during the journey and to provide moral support upon arriving back.  Tychicus also carried with him the letter to the Colossian Church bearing the latest news from the Apostle Paul (Colossians 4:7-9).  Pastor Art uses the short letter of Philemon as a model for change and transformation.  In his short message Pastor Art discusses how modern day Christians can affect change in an ungodly culture through the message of love.","The Book of Philemon"
"0900","Hebrews","The book of Hebrews has an unknown author.  Many in the past have thought that the Apostle Paul wrote it, or maybe Barnabas or Apollos.  In recent centuries, since the Reformation, most have concluded that we just do not know who wrote it.  Nevertheless, the Church, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit has accepted the canonicity and inspiration of Hebrews. 
It appears to have been written mainly to Hebrew or Jewish Christians, who under persecution were thinking of abandoning their Christian faith and reverting back to Judaism.  The writer exhorts them to hold fast to the truth of Jesus Christ and not to forsake their faith in him.
Hebrews was written prior to the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, since this event is not referenced.
The theme of the book is the superiority of Jesus Christ.  He is superior to angels, to Moses, to the Aaronic priesthood, and to the Mosaic sacrifices.  Jesus is God's last word to humankind for salvation.  Strong warnings against the consequences of apostasy are given in both chapters 6 and 10.  Well known is the roll call of the heroes of faith in chapter 11.  These Old Testament saints are examples of faith for us to follow.
The book closes with practical exhortations to live out the Christian life in faith and practical service.","The Book of Hebrews"
"0950","James","The book of James is one of the seven general epistles (James to Jude in the New Testament).  It was written, it is believed, by James, the half-brother of Jesus, about A.D. 48 to A.D. 50 most likely in Jerusalem.  It was written to Jews, who had scattered around the Roman Empire (James 1:1).   
The book is very Jewish in character and was written early undoubtedly when the church was still mostly Jewish in membership.  It doesn't seem to reflect any of the issues one typically finds in the Pauline letters.       
  James became an early leader in the Jerusalem Church (Acts 15:13; ICor.15:7; Acts 21:18; Gal. 2:9, 12).  He played a key leadership role in the Council of Jerusalem and the decision to more clearly define what it means to be Christian.
  The writing itself contains five chapters.  It is profoundly practical, demanding not just faith-words but faith - actions to demonstrate the authenticity of one's personal faith in Jesus.  James wrote like a prophet of the Old Testament - telling it like it is.  He warns and exhorts.  Clearly, his desire is to have believers who are genuinely Christians and not just a lot of talk.","The Book of James"
"0960","1st Peter","Simon Peter wrote the book of 1st Peter from ""Babylon"" (the city of Babylon in Mesopotamia? a town in Egypt? or the figurative name for Rome?) around A.D. 60, before or after.  A wide range of subjects is covered, all of which are intended to strengthen the church in Northern Asia Minor in the face of a growing persecution.  This is not a formal academic lecture (such as Romans) but rather a pastor exhorting his congregation.  There is much in this letter that is relevant to Christians in the 21st Century.","1st Peter"
"0970","2nd Peter","2nd Peter was written probably by the Apostle Peter, perhaps from Rome around A.D. 65 to 67.  It was written shortly before his death apparently to the same churches he addressed in the first letter - namely the churches of Northern Asia Minor.  There is no reference to suffering; therefore the threat of persecution must have disappeared, at least for the moment.  There is much admonition to holy living, especially in the light of ""the Day of the Lord"".","2nd Peter"
"1000","1st John","The beloved books of 1st, 2nd, & 3rd John were written by the Apostle John, who was one of the original 12 disciples.  The authorship is not indicated in the text of the letters such as is found in the Pauline letters.  Nevertheless, external evidence for the authorship of these three epistles by John is strong and without significant controversy.
The Apostle John wrote five New Testament books:  the Gospel of John, 1st, 2nd, & 3rd John, and the book of Revelation.
John originally ministered in Jerusalem.  Early church tradition tells us that he left Jerusalem (probably well ahead of the destruction of the temple in A.D. 70) and went to the Roman province of Asia.  There he ministered in and around Ephesus and probably with all of the seven churches of Asia described in Revelation 2 and 3.
The date of writing was most likely about A.D. 95.  John, the aged father of the churches wrote to his beloved children.
The purpose of John's writings was to reassure these Christians, who were living in a difficult pagan environment, that they were indeed the children of God.  It was further an encouragement for these believers to love one another in true Christian fellowship.  There were also warnings about both internal and external threats of false teaching, insincere Christian living, and the difficulty of sin in the believer's life.","1st John"
"1050","2nd John","The beloved books of 1st, 2nd, & 3rd John were written by the Apostle John, who was one of the original 12 disciples.

Early church tradition tells us that he left Jerusalem (probably well ahead of the destruction of the temple in A.D. 70) and went to the Roman province of Asia.  There he ministered in and around Ephesus and probably with all of the seven churches of Asia described in Revelation 2 and 3.
The date of writing was most likely about A.D. 95.  John, the aged father of the churches wrote to his beloved children.
The purpose of John's writings was to reassure these Christians, who were living in a difficult pagan environment, that they were indeed the children of God.  It was further an encouragement for these believers to love one another in true Christian fellowship.  There were also warnings about both internal and external threats of false teaching, insincere Christian living, and the difficulty of sin in the believer's life.","2nd John"
"1100","3rd John","The beloved books of 1st, 2nd, & 3rd John were written by the Apostle John, who was one of the original 12 disciples.  The authorship is not indicated in the text of the letters such as is found in the Pauline letters.  Nevertheless, external evidence for the authorship of these three epistles by John is strong and without significant controversy.

"1150","Jude","The book of Jude was written, most likely by another half brother of Jesus (the other one being James).  It was written about A.D. 65.
It is a short, one chapter writing originally penned to extol God's salvation in Jesus Christ (1:3).  However, he found it necessary to change his plans and exhort and warn the church about false teachings that some were bringing into the church.  Jude doesn't spare any words as he warns the church to be careful of error.  He lays it on the line!
The chapter ends with a very positive benediction (1:24-25) bringing praise to God who is able to keep his people from falling.","The Book of Jude"
"1200","Revelation","The book of Revelation is the one prophetic book of the New Testament with 22 chapters.  It was written by the Apostle John, one of Jesus' disciples, who also wrote the Gospel of John and the three epistles of John - five New Testament books in all.  Revelation was written as John was in exile for his faith on the island of Patmos about A.D. 95.
The book divides itself into three principal parts.  First, an opening vision of Jesus and messages to the seven churches of the Roman province of Asia.  Second, there follows most of the book, which is a description of the seven years of tribulation that will come upon the earth: seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls - the pressure God is bringing on the earth to secure repentance among the peoples.  It all draws to a close with the second coming of Jesus Christ - King of kings and Lord of lords (19:16).  Third, the book then ends with a brief description of the judgment and the new heavens and new earth.
This marvelous book was written to encourage the suffering saints, persecuted by the Roman Empire.  Evil will not win.  God will!  It has much encouragement for every subsequent generation, because the end of things has not yet come.  But it will.  We need to be prepared.","The Book of Revelation"

"1410","The Life of Jesus","The life of Jesus could be considered in a number of ways.  Pastor Art has elected to touch on the high-points of the Lord's earthly existence and to do so in 12 lessons.  This will take the listener from the eternity of Jesus through his earthly sojourn and back into his eternal state.  Above all you will see Jesus as the Second Person of the Holy Trinity and in that role as the redeemer of humankind.
A possible chronology of the life and ministry of Jesus is as follows:
Birth                 4 B.C.
Year of Inauguration 26-27 A.D.
Year of Popularity    27-28 A.D.
Year of Opposition    28-29 A.D.
Death and Resurrection          29 A.D.
Contemplate now the most magnificent life ever lived.  And he lives forever.

"1430","Biblical Theology 101  ","""I Believe"" Series
The study of theology is the consideration of God and all that relates to Him.  The source of our information is the Bible, the uniquely inspired Word of God.  
This series, ""I Believe"", is not designed to be comprehensive or a technical work for professionals.  Rather it is intended for lay Christians, who desire to have a more systematic knowledge of and approach to Biblical truth.  
Hopefully, these lessons will whet the appetite of the student so that serious future study might be undertaken in an evangelical school of higher education or personally in evangelical theological books -or both.

"1440","Prophecy 101","Prophecy is eschatology or the study of the end times.  The subject of Bible prophecy is complicated and can be controversial.  There are various interpretations by good and competent persons.  I do not claim to be an authority in this area.  The late Dr. Bernard Ramm once said, ""Teach thy tongue to say, I do not know.""  That is a wise statement to be applied in many fields.  I would add a warning:  Don't trust anyone who claims to have the last word on prophecy.  When we come to this subject, we all need a humble heart and mind.  
Yet there are some future events in Holy Scripture that are not all that complicated.  Those are the things I wish to concentrate on.  Probably none of us is an expert on prophecy.  We are all life-long students of this subject.  If prophecy is new to you, the following lessons will be something of an introduction.  I hope you will enjoy the lessons and draw closer to Jesus Christ as a result.

"1450","Family Life 101","The life of the Christian family is of great concern to the believer.  We live in a time, in the Western World, when the family is in breakdown.  It is said that 50% of all marriages end in divorce.  Sometimes there are children involved.  They are greatly impacted.  Then comes the reconstituted family with his kids, her kids and our kids.  That has its challenges.  
Family Life 101 is not meant to cover all the bases or to take the place of professional counselors.  Rather this is supplemental material from the Word of God that will assist Christian families is structuring and maintaining wholesome family living in the 21st Century.

"1465","Fruit of the Spirit","The ""Fruit of the Spirit"", based on Galations 5:22-23, is all about the Godly characteristics the Holy Spirit wants to grow inside each believer.  We all have these nine characteristics in us, but they have been severely damaged by sin.  Therefore, following our salvation the Holy Spirit takes up residence in us and begins the process of not only damage control, but also damage repair.  That's what these lessons are about - how the Holy Spirit works in our lives all through life to make us more like Jesus in nine important areas.

"1466","Spiritual Disciplines 101","Spiritual Disciplines are practices that draw us near to God.  The disciplines themselves are not the objective.  What we want is to know God.  Through these disciplines we draw near to God and God draws near to us.
In six lessons we examine 12 different spiritual disciplines.  These are not things that we master all at once.  We must gradually learn these practices.  As they develop in our lives they vindicate themselves as valuable in our spiritual growth.
Pastor Art is indebted to Richard J. Foster and his book, Celebration of Discipline, for the concepts and much of the content of the lessons below.

"1467","Growing in Christ","The apostle Peter wrote in his second letter, ""Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ"" (2Peter 3:18).  Just the word ""grow"" implies our need for progress.  As Christians there is always new territory to claim.  
The areas in which we are to grow are grace and knowledge.  Grace is the help from God that we do not deserve but desperately need.  The area of growth is in the knowledge of our Savior and Lord, Jesus Christ.  There is always more to know about Jesus and the Bible is our source book.  Of course, the end result of experiencing more of the grace and knowledge of Jesus is to become more like him - and he is holy.
The 17 lessons in the Growing in Christ series are designed to move us from our new birth right on through important stages in the Christian life.  There is no claim here to be comprehensive.  However, there is much in these lessons to make each of us more Christ - like and therefore more to the praise of his glory.
