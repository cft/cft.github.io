Prophecy is eschatology or the study of the end times. The subject of Bible prophecy is complicated and can be controversial. There are various interpretations by good and competent persons. I do not claim to be an authority in this area. The late Dr. Bernard Ramm once said, "Teach thy tongue to say, I do not know." That is a wise statement to be applied in many fields. I would add a warning: Don't trust anyone who claims to have the last word on prophecy. When we come to this subject, we all need a humble heart and mind.

Yet there are some future events in Holy Scripture that are not all that complicated. Those are the things I wish to concentrate on. Probably none of us is an expert on prophecy. We are all life-long students of this subject. If prophecy is new to you, the following lessons will be something of an introduction. I hope you will enjoy the lessons and draw closer to Jesus Christ as a result.
