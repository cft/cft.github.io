The Book of Titus is one of three "pastoral letters" in the New Testament: 1 & 2 Timothy and Titus. The writer identifies himself as Paul (Titus 1:1). He writes to "Titus, my true son", (Titus 1:4). The letter was most likely written soon after Paul's release from house arrest in Rome ca. A.D 62 or 63 (Acts 28).

Paul sent Titus to the Island of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea located just below both present day Greece and Turkey to give spiritual direction to a troubled church. There were false teachers in this church that needed to be dealt with. As the mentor of Titus, Paul gave instructions both theological and practical to guide the leadership of Titus in this sensitive mission. Those instructions are valid for our times as well.
