"I Believe" Series

The study of theology is the consideration of God and all that relates to Him. The source of our information is the Bible, the uniquely inspired Word of God.

This series, "I Believe," is not designed to be comprehensive or a technical work for professionals. Rather it is intended for lay Christians, who desire to have a more systematic knowledge of and approach to Biblical truth.

Hopefully, these lessons will whet the appetite of the student so that serious future study might be undertaken in an evangelical school of higher education or personally in evangelical theological booksâ€”or both.
