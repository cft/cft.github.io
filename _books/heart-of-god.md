What is God really interested in? What moves his heart? The following lessons tell you what is important to God.

Pastor Art has made use of source material in a series of studies by various authors on The Heart of God appearing in Decision Magazine in the decade of the 1990s - a publication of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. He has also included his own Biblical information and experiences. What emerged is an interesting set of merged lessons for which Pastor Art is alone responsible. He is sure that the lessons will help a person understand the Triune God better and draw closer to Him.
