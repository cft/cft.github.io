  Zephaniah: Tough and Tender Love
description: >-
  The northern Kingdom of Israel had already fallen to Assyria. It wouldn't be long until Babylonia would come and conquer the southern Kingdom of Judah. Zephaniah is the last prophet to speak before the fall of Jerusalem and Judah. It is a stinging indictment against Judah, but not without a note of hope for God's people.
