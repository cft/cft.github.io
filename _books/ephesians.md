By way of his missionary journeys Paul spent extended time in the province of Asia in Ephesus and other cities. He established friendships with many there. Interestingly, Paul's letter to the Ephesians has none of his usual personal greetings and does not deal with any particular problems or news. Therefore, most Bible scholars believe that the Book of Ephesians began as a circular letter written by Paul to a group of churches in what is now western Turkey.

The church at Ephesus was one of the churches in the area as were the churches at Colossae and Laodicia. Many Bible scholars believe that Paul wrote this letter probably from prison (house arrest/Acts 28:3-31) in Rome in the years around A.D. 60. Other letters written during the same period are Philippians, Colossians and Philemon.

The general nature of the letter provides few clues to the situation in the church at Ephesus, with the exception that there is a general theme that urges the churches of Gentile Christians to unite with their fellow Jewish Christians in common faith. Although Paul had been specially called by the Lord to work among the Gentiles (Acts 9:15), the theme in this letter focuses around God's glorious plan to bring men and women of every nation and background together in Christ (Eph. 1:10; 2:14-19).

The letter itself is generally divided into two parts: Chapters 1-3/theological; Chapters 4-6/practical. The first three theological chapters are perhaps the most profound writing of the apostle on the theme of salvation.

In 12 Bible messages Pastor Art explores Paul's letter to the Ephesians and brings out key messages that emphasize that as Christians, all are on equal terms. Pastor Art also focuses a number of messages on what it means to be an authentic follower of Christ through family relationships. The final message in the series, The Believer's Battle Dress, cautions Christians that the Devil is alive and on the prowl. However, with the power of God it is possible to successfully live the Christian life in the face of an enemy who desperately wants to defeat Christians.

Your Christian life will definitely be enriched by the inspired writing of the Apostle Paul called Ephesians.
