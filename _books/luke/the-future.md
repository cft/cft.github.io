  The Future
description: >-
  Jesus only preached one prophetic sermon. It is recorded in the three synoptic (same) gospels: Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21. Luke gives us four things that will characterize the world just prior to Jesus' return. Jesus is coming again! Are we ready for his return?
