The book of Second Corinthians was most likely also written in A.D. 55, but from Macedonia (2Cor 2:13; 7:5). Paul is the author (2Cor. 1:1). This letter is intensely personal and contains more autobiographical material than any of his other writings.

Paul had indicated that he planned to visit Corinth again (1Cor. 16:5-7). However, he had a change in plans, at least, in timing. This caused some in the Corinthian Church to accuse Paul of deceiving them (saying "yes, I'm coming", but really meaning "no, I'm not coming"). It was alleged, Paul's word could not be trusted. In fact, false teachers had arisen in the Corinthian Church, who were stirring things up by saying that Paul was not a true apostle and that he could not be trusted with the church money collected for the famine stricken Christians of Jerusalem. Furthermore, these false teachers claimed they had a better gospel. Paul answers his critics in a tender but firm way. His personal life was above reproach, his teaching was true and he was still coming to Corinth.

This second epistle can easily be divided into three main sections: the reason for the change in plans (chs.1-7); the collection of money for the needy in Jerusalem (chs. 8-9); the authenticity of Paul's apostleship (chs. 10-13).

While the Book of Acts tells of Paul's physical sufferings for Christ, the second letter to the Corinthians gives us an insight into the spiritual and emotional sufferings of Paul - and of any true minister of Jesus Christ.
