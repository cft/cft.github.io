The book of Philippians is one of four Prison Epistles (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon), written by the Apostle Paul while he was in prison for his Christian faith. The place of writing was either Caesarea (Acts 24:27) or Rome (Acts 28:30). He spent two years in prison in each location and would have had opportunity to write these letters. Probably he wrote this letter from Rome about A.D.61.

Paul penned this epistle to the church at Philippi (Acts 16), a church that he dearly loved. In spite of the unfavorable conditions under which he wrote, it is a delightful piece of work in four chapters, written mostly in a positive tone. Notable is the fact that the word "joy" appears 16 times in its various forms. There are also many warnings about the perils that face any church - then or now.

The most profound statement on the meaning of the incarnation is found in Philippians 2:5-11. This is one of those special, don't-miss teaching paragraphs. Also, at the end of the book there is a special section on Paul's attitude toward the material things of life. Again, a don't-miss paragraph.
