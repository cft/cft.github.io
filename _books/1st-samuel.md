First and Second Samuel are named after the man, Samuel, who transitioned Israel from the rule of the judges to the monarchy. Samuel anointed both Saul and David as the first two successive kings of Israel.

First Samuel can be outlined in this manner:

 - Samuel's birth, youth and calling (1 Samuel 1-7)
 - The establishment of the kingship (1 Samuel 8-12)
 - The failure of Saul's kingship (1 Samuel 13-15)
 - David's rise to power (1 Samuel 16-31)

The lessons below concern themselves primarily with the life of David before he became king.
