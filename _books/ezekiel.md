The writer of this book is Ezekiel, the prophet-priest of the Babylonian exile. He was exiled along with 10,000 Jews from Judea to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar in 597 B.C. In 586 B.C. there was a final siege on Jerusalem by the Babylonians, at which time the city and the Temple were burned.

Ezekiel wrote this prophesy from Babylonia, preceding the destruction of Jerusalem by 7 years and following it by 15 years. These 22 years of his prophetic activity exceeded a priest's normal service by two years. (Priests served from age 30 to age 50, after which they entered semi-retirement and assisted others in ministry.)

The book of Ezekiel can be outlined in the following way:
Jerusalem and the Temple will fall - Chapters.1 to 24
Seven surrounding nations will be judged - Chapters. 25 to 32
A word of hope given for God's people - Chapters. 33 to 48

The prophecy of Ezekiel proclaims God's sovereignty over creation, people, nations and the course of history.
