  Haggai: Let us Rebuild
description: >-
  A remnant has now returned to Jerusalem from the Babylonian exile. About a hundred years have passed (a 70 year exile) since the writing of Zephaniah and that of Haggai. The people had failed to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. The prophet indicts them for wrong priorities.
