  Mark 16

  He Has Risen
description: >-
  Do people really believe in the literal, bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead? You bet they do! Proof abounds that it happened and no reasonable mind can doubt it. More importantly, the resurrection was the validation of all Jesus claimed to be and all he did on the cross for our salvation.
