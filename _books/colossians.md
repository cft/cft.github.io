The book of Colossians is one of four "Prison Epistles" (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon) written by the Apostle Paul about A.D. 60 - 61. The village of Colosse was a Roman city in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) at the base of the 8,000 foot Mt. Cadmus in the Lycus River valley 100 miles east of Ephesus. Actually, there were three small towns in this valley: Colosse, Laodicaea and Hierapolis. All three are mentioned in this letter. Interestingly, Paul never personally visited this valley as far as we know (2:1).

The church at Colosse may have been started by Epaphras, one of Paul's close co-workers. Epaphras was from Colosse (4:12) and cared deeply about this church.

This short letter has great sections on the deity of Jesus Christ (1:15,19), his active participation in the creation of the world (1:16) and the fullness of understanding in him (2:2). Colossians is a great Christological book. Also, rules for family life in Paul's times are found in the third chapter. All-in-all, Colossians is rich in Christian doctrine and directions for practical Christian living.
