The "Fruit of the Spirit", based on Galations 5:22-23, is all about the Godly characteristics the Holy Spirit wants to grow inside each believer. We all have these nine characteristics in us, but they have been severely damaged by sin. Therefore, following our salvation the Holy Spirit takes up residence in us and begins the process of not only damage control, but also damage repair. That's what these lessons are about - how the Holy Spirit works in our lives all through life to make us more like Jesus in nine important areas.
