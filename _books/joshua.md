Joshua is a record of the conquest of the Promised Land. After some 400 years of bondage in Egypt and now 40 years in the wilderness, Joshua and the people entered the land promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They first had to overcome the kings of Canaan before they could distribute the land to the 12 tribes of Israel.
