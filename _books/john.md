The Gospel of John is a record primarily of what Jesus said, especially claims He made about himself. The style of the writer is different than Mathew's Gospel which records Jesus' sayings. The author of John, who refers to himself simply as "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (21 :20, 24), assumes that the readers already know the facts about Jesus' life. He writes to bring out the meaning of the events that take place by focusing on the miracles (seven "signs") which show most clearly who He was--the God-Man. The main aim of the author is to bring the reader to a personal faith in Jesus as Savior and Lord (20:30-31).

Unlike Mathew, there are no parables in John. Most of the events recorded take place in and around Jerusalem at the various festivals where Jesus utilized a teaching method that was appropriate for the business, political and theological climate of the region.

The Gospel of John was the last of the four gospels to be written. Scholars believe it was probably written around AD 90. The early church taught that the aged Apostle John wrote or dictated this "spiritual" Gospel from Ephesus located in present-day Turkey.

Pastor Art teaches from each of the 21 chapters of the Gospel of John and explains in modern-day terms the timeless focus of John's Gospelâ€”namely, Jesus is the promised Messiah and the Son of God.
