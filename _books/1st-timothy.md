1st Timothy is one of three "pastoral epistles," namely 1st Timothy, 2nd Timothy and Titus. These books were written by the missionary-evangelist, Paul, to his younger proteges, Timothy, who was pastoring the Ephesian church, and Titus, who was pastoring the church on the island of Crete. This book was probably written about A.D 60.

Timothy was a younger man, whom Paul met during his second missionary journey. Timothy joined the evangelistic team and traveled with Paul. Later Paul sent him to Ephesus to pastor this promising church.

Paul instructs Timothy, his "true son in the faith," on certain basic issues of early church life. In contrast to 2nd Timothy, this first letter is all about church order in the local assembly of believers. It is relevant to churches in the 21st Century.
