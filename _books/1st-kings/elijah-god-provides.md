  Elijah: God Provides
description: >-
  Elijah prophesied a famine against the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the wicked King Ahab. This didn't make Elijah too popular. But God protected Elijah by hiding him in the ravine of Kerith, east of the Jordan. And later Elijah went Sidon to the widow of Zarephath and her son. In both the ravine and the widow's house God did amazing things to provide for Elijah's needs!
