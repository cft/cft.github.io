  Practice Hospitality
description: >-
  Paul tells us to "practice hospitality". Peter adds, "without grumbling". Dr. David Batstone shares these points that Pastor Art will make use of: hospitality and joy; the guest as a messenger of good news; the warning of failed hospitality; and we are all strangers in search of hospitality.
