  Marriage and Singleness
description: >-
  This chapter is about Christian marriage. It might seem from this chapter that Paul is anti-marriage. That can be explained. Otherwise, he writes about the purity of marriage, the permanence of marriage and the power of marriage. Finally, he speaks of the privilege of singleness.
