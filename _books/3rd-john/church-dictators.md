  3rd John 1:1-14 - Church Dictators
passage: >-
  3rd John 1:1-14
name: >-
  Church Dictators
description: >-
  As 2nd John was addressed to a godly woman about protecting her family, so 3rd John is written to a godly man about protecting his church. John actually gives names. He commends Gaius, the encourager. He warns against Diotrephes, the church dictator. (What a difficult man he was.) He extols Demetrius, the example, who was well spoken of by all.
