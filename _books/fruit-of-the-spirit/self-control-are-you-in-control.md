  Self-control - Are You in Control?
description: >-
  Self-control is keeping a balance between extremes. It is resisting the temptation to go to extremes. It is temperance and moderation. It is the maturity that does the right thing at the right time - in the control of the mind, of the emotions and the body. Only the Holy Spirit can make this possible.
