The book of First Corinthians was authored by the Apostle Paul (1Cor. 1:1). The letter was written about A.D. 55 toward the end of Paul's three year ministry in Ephesus (1Cor. 16:8).

The story of the successful founding of the Corinthian Church by Paul is found in Acts 18. Paul spent a year and a half in this ministry at Corinth.

In Paul's time, the city of Corinth is estimated to have had 250,000 free citizens and an additional 400,000 slaves. Thus the total population approximated 650,000 people. Corinth was a large city.

The worship of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, was a main feature of Corinthian religious life. This worship advocated prostitution in the name of religion. Is it any wonder that the people saved out of such an evil culture had problems in their young church?

Paul received information about several difficult issues that had arisen in this church since his departure. Thus he wrote First Corinthians to guide this young church in matters of Christian conduct.

The following topics are addressed: Disunity in the fellowship, immorality in the church, lawsuits among the members, marriage or singleness, food sacrificed to idols, personal rights, the Lord's Supper, spiritual gifts, Divine love, the practice of tongues, and the resurrection of the dead.
