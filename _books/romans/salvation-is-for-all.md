  Romans 9-11
name: >-
  Salvation is For All
description: >-
  Having completed the major theological content of the book (Chapters 1-8), Paul now turns his attention to the historic people of God--Israel. He believes that one day they will accept their Messiah, Jesus, and be saved. This in no way limits the salvation of the world, namely the Gentiles. Christ died for all!
