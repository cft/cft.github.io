  Romans 16
name: >-
  People Matter!
description: >-
  Paul lists a lot of people in the Roman Church--names that we can hardly pronounce and with many of them, we are not sure if they are male or female. Do we just skip over this? No way! People matter. Every member of the church is important. You matter and so does your fellow Christian.
