  Major Steps in Christian Growth
description: >-
  Paul now gives his attention to experiential Christianity (Chapters 12-16), i.e., how we live out the Christian life. He begins with a passionate appeal that the believer would take yet another step in his/her Christian growth by committing themselves 100% to the Lord Jesus. Following our initial experience of salvation, we need to go on to a deeper level of commitment to Christ. He tells us how to do this.
