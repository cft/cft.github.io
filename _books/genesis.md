The book of Genesis is a book of beginnings - the beginning of the world, of the human race, of a man of faith and a family of faith.

It can easily be divided into the lives of the principal characters of the book:

- Adam - Genesis 1-5
- Noah - Genesis 6-11
- Abraham - Genesis 12-25
- Isaac - Genesis 26
- Jacob - Genesis 27-36
- Joseph - Genesis 37-50

Genesis is above all the beginning of God's self-revelation. God reveals both his power and character through his names. It is also the beginning of the revelation of God's plan of salvation for a lost human race.
