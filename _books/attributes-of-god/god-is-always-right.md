  God is Always Right?!
description: >-
  If God is righteous and good, why do bad things happen to good people? Although that is a hard but not impossible question to answer, of these things we can be certain: Gods character is righteous; His conduct is righteous; His commands are righteous. In view of this, we affirm, God is always right.
