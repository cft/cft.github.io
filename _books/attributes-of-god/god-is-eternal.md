  God is Eternal
description: >-
  The Scriptures speak of the Divine Being as the Eternal God. From everlasting to everlasting, He is God. He is above and outside of our experience of time and space. God is Eternal in his Being, in his attributes and purposes. His fellowship is also eternal for those who love and obey Him.
