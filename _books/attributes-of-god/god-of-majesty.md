  Attributes of God Lesson 18
name: >-
  God of Majesty
description: >-
  Many of us in the Western Democracies are unaccustomed to majesty, with the exception of the citizens of the British Empire. We see God's majesty in creation. In our personal experience of God there is often a profound depth involved. Three of the disciples experienced the Transfiguration of Jesus. What an event that was. We all need to experience something of the Majesty of the Triune God sometime in our lives.
