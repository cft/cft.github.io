  Attributes of God Lesson 13
name: >-
  God is Patient
description: >-
  Using both the Old Testament books of Nahum and Jonah, the patience of God is noted. Three points are emphasized in this lesson: an example of patience, a definition of patience and a duplication of patience. Patience is not an easy thing in the human temperament. With God's help we can practice patience.
