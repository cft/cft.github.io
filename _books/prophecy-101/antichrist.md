  Prophecy 101 Lesson 5
name: >-
  Antichrist
description: >-
  This lesson is taken from scriptures as revealed in Daniel 7, Matthew 24, 2Thess.2, and Revelation 13.  The word "Antichrist" only appears one time in the Bible, namely in 1st John. But other Bible books speak of this evil person as "the little horn", "the man of lawlessness", and "the beast out of the sea". The Antichrist will appear in the world. Listen to this lesson to find out what will happen.
