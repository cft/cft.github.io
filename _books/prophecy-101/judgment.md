  Prophecy 101 Lesson 7
name: >-
  Judgment
description: >-
  In this lesson, based on Revelation 20:11-15, pastor Art teaches about the "great white throne" judgment of God at the end of all things. All will appear before this judgment throne of Christ ( ref. 2 Corinthians 5:10). Christian believers will not face condemnation (ref John 3:16-21). Unbelievers will be judged and punished.
