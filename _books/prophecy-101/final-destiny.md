  Final Destiny
description: >-
  In this lesson, Pastor Art answers the question, "What will heaven be like - in the words of Jesus, Paul and John?   Revelation 21-22 is the basis for this description of eternity where Christians will be with Jesus for all time. That has to be very good. In order to be with Him in all eternity your name must be written in the Lamb's Book of Life now. Be ready to meet God.
