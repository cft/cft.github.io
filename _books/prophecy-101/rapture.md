  Prophecy 101 Lesson 4
name: >-
  Rapture
description: >-
  1Thessalonians 4 is used as the key text resource for this lesson. The rapture is not to be confused with the Second Coming of Jesus Christ (ref. Revelation 19).  The rapture is only spoken of by the Apostle Paul in the New Testament book of 1Thessalonians 4. It is the time prior to, during or at the end of the Great Tribulation (there is difference of viewpoint among careful thinkers), when Christians will suddenly disappear from the earth and meet Jesus in the air.
