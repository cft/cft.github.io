This letter was Paul's last. He is once again a prisoner for Christ - this time facing death. It is an intensely personal epistle written from the heart of the old warrior, Paul, to the younger minister, Timothy. Paul opens his heart as he reflects on his own ministry and on that of Timothy. It is a challenge that any minister or layperson can read with great profit.
