2nd Peter was written probably by the Apostle Peter, perhaps from Rome around A.D. 65 to 67. It was written shortly before his death apparently to the same churches he addressed in the first letter - namely the churches of Northern Asia Minor. There is no reference to suffering; therefore the threat of persecution must have disappeared, at least for the moment. There is much admonition to holy living, especially in the light of "the Day of the Lord".
