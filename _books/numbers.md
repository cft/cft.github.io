The book of Numbers comes from the Septuagint (LXX) and is named for the census lists found in chapters 1 and 26. The Hebrew title of this book is "bemidbar" and means "in the desert," which covers the content of the book more accurately. This is the record of the ca. 40 year wilderness wanderings of Israel before they entered the Promised Land.
