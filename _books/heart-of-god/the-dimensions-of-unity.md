  Heart of God Lesson 4
name: >-
  The Dimensions of Unity
description: >-
  Our world is severely divided. People are divided. Jesus died on the cross to end the sin that divides nations and people from each other. Jesus prayed in John 17 that his followers might all be one, just as Jesus is one with the Father. Paul tells is in Ephesians that the cross of Christ breaks down the walls that divide us.
