  Heart of God Lesson 11
name: >-
  Ready and Waiting
description: >-
  Jesus is coming again. What a glorious prospect. A believer is called upon to be in a high state of readiness for the return of Jesus to this earth. Suffering and doctrinal error will characterize the end times. Until he returns we must be ready to witness to God's grace in our lives and to do good in the lives of others.
