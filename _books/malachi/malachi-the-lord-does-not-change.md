  Malachi: The Lord Does Not Change
description: >-
  This prophet is the last in the Old Testament. There would then be 400 years of prophetic silence between the Old and New Testaments until the appearance of John the Baptist. The temple and the wall around Jerusalem had been rebuilt. But a spiritual complacency had set in. Spiritual renewal was necessary.
