Spiritual Disciplines are practices that draw us near to God. The disciplines themselves are not the objective. What we want is to know God. Through these disciplines we draw near to God and God draws near to us.

In six lessons we examine 12 different spiritual disciplines. These are not things that we master all at once. We must gradually learn these practices. As they develop in our lives they vindicate themselves as valuable in our spiritual growth.

Pastor Art is indebted to Richard J. Foster and his book, Celebration of Discipline, for the concepts and much of the content of the lessons below.
