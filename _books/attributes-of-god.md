The study of the attributes (characteristics) of God is exciting. It tells us what God is like and how he relates to us.

Pastor Art has made use of source material in a series of studies by various authors on The Attributes of God appearing in Decision Magazine in the decade of the 1990s - a publication of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. He also included his own Biblical information and experiences. What emerged is an interesting set of merged lessons that will help a person understand the Triune God better and draw closer to Him.
