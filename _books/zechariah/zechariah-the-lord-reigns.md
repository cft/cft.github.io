  Zechariah: The Lord Reigns
description: >-
  Here is a very positive prophet. There is forth-telling of God's truth, but most of the book is fore-telling future events. There are a series of visions about the coming of Christ and the end times. These visions are similar to those found in Daniel, Ezekiel and the New Testament book of Revelation.
