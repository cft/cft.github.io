  Give it All Away - Stewardship
description: >-
  God has given us all we have. It all belongs to him. We are but trustees. How shall be use our resources for both our needs, the care of the church and sharing the "good news" of Jesus? From Luke 18, Pastor Art teaches on the importance of stewardship in the Christian life.
