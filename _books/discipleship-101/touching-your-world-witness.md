  Touching Your World - Witness
description: >-
  In Mathew 28 all believers are called upon to be a witness for Christ. By life and in words we tell our story of what God has done for us in his Son, Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit works with us to impact an observing and listening world. Listen as Pastor Art teaches on the importance of witnessing what Christ has done for you.
