The life of the Christian family is of great concern to the believer. We live in a time, in the Western World, when the family is in breakdown. It is said that 50% of all marriages end in divorce. Sometimes there are children involved. They are greatly impacted. Then comes the reconstituted family with his kids, her kids and our kids. That has its challenges.

Family Life 101 is not meant to cover all the bases or to take the place of professional counselors. Rather this is supplemental material from the Word of God that will assist Christian families is structuring and maintaining wholesome family living in the 21st Century.
