  Growing in Christ Ephesians 5:17
name: >-
  Finding the Will of God
description: >-
  As we seek the will of the Lord in any given situation, keep in mind, God may change the situation; God may show you how to change the situation; God may leave the situation as it is, but change the one doing the praying. In the end, we expect to know and see the will of God.
