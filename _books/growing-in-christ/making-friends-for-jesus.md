  Making Friends For Jesus
description: >-
  The Rev. Royal S. Nelson once said, "Jesus had only 12 disciples, but he had many friends." Nelson went on to explain that it is out of our pool of friends that we influence people to turn to Christ as Savior and Lord. The Southern Baptist method of evangelism is introduced: First, meet my family. Second, meet my church. Third, meet my Savior.
