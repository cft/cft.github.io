  Growing in Christ John 15:4
name: >-
  Staying Close to God
description: >-
  Jesus teaches us that we are to "abide" or "remain" in him. This is very important as we are to be fruit-bearing Christians. The Old Testament example of Elijah is used. The daily devotional life of the Christian is imperative, if we are to abide in Christ and bear fruit for him.
