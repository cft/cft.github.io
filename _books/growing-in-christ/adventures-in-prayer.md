  Adventures in Prayer
description: >-
  Pastor Art follows the simple outline from Dr. Eldon Trueblood of the Lord's Prayer for this lesson: Thank you! Help me! Help my friends! This is, as Catherine Marshall put it, about "the asking prayer." Every prayer matters. Every prayer makes a difference. Prayer must be a growing part of the Christian life.
