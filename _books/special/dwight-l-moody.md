  Throughout the past several centuries key persons of faith have shaped and been an instrumental part in spreading the Gospel of the Christian faith. Dwight L. Moody (1837-1899) was one such man.   Moody started his ministry by organizing Sunday Schools for children. He moved to evangelism making his mark at first in England. He later founded the Moody Memorial Church and Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois. He was never formally ordained but was a great one-on-one soul winner and in large meetings as well.
