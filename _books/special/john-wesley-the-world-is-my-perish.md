  John Wesley - "The World is my Perish"
description: >-
  Throughout the past several centuries key persons of faith have shaped and been an instrumental part in spreading the Gospel of the Christian faith. John Wesley (1703-1791) was one such man.  Pastor Art has visited the Wesley Chapel, Wesley House and Wesley Grave all on the same property in London, England. Wesley was and remained an Anglican priest. He also found assurance of salvation as the Preface to the exposition on the book of Romans (a work by Martin Luther) was being read in the Aldersgate Street. He said, "I felt my heart strangely warmed." He is the founder of the worldwide Methodist movement. "The world is my parish," said Wesley.
