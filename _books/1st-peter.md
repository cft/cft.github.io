Simon Peter wrote the book of 1st Peter from "Babylon" (the city of Babylon in Mesopotamia? a town in Egypt? or the figurative name for Rome?) around A.D. 60, before or after. A wide range of subjects is covered, all of which are intended to strengthen the church in Northern Asia Minor in the face of a growing persecution. This is not a formal academic lecture (such as Romans) but rather a pastor exhorting his congregation. There is much in this letter that is relevant to Christians in the 21st Century.
