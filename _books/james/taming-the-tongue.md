  Taming the Tongue
description: >-
  Even for Christians it is a struggle to control the tongue. It can be used to bless or to curse. Wit God's help we can learn to use our voices to help and not hurt others. If we consistently do not control the tongue, there is a real question about the legitimate character of our Christian faith.
