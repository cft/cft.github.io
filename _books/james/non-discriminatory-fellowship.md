  James 2:1-13
name: >-
  Non-discriminatory Fellowship
description: >-
  In the Christian life, words and actions need to be consistent with each other. The exhortation is: "Don't show favoritism!" The example is: Our treatment of the rich and the poor. This is valid today in the discrimination shown towards other races. Christians are called upon to value people: rich or poor, black or white, educated or uneducated.
