  Test Your Actions
description: >-
  Christians are to test their actions. We are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone. Now we are to live lives that exhibit the fruit of the Spirit in our lives. Holiness of life will manifest itself in a gentle and humble spirit, in living to please the Holy Spirit and in keeping the cross of Christ at the center of our Christian consciousness.
