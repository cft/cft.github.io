  Galatians 4:1-20
name: >-
  Bondage Broken by Grace
description: >-
  Using a different metaphor, Paul speaks of moving from slavery to the full rights of a son and how this applies to salvation. With a deep appeal of love, he urges the Galatian Christians to stay the course and not to turn from their freedom in Christ back to the bondage of sin in their former lives.
