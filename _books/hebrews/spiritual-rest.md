  Hebrews 4
name: >-
  Spiritual Rest
description: >-
  The Christian life is a journey from spiritual chaos to spiritual rest. We begin by getting out of the chaos of sin. Then we find ourselves in the very early stages of Christian living with many struggles. It is God's purpose to lead us on into a settled and consistent Christian life-style. Hebrews 11 is all about a committed Christian life.
