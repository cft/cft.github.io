  Hebrews 9-10:22
name: >-
  Only One Sacrifice
description: >-
  The forgiveness of sins requires a sacrifice to atone for evil. In the "old agreement", animal blood was used by the priests. But, that was only a symbol and a type. Such sacrifices had to be offered over and over again. The sacrifice of the body of Christ was real and happened once and for all. It saves us for all eternity.
