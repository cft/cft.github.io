Ruth is a short love story of four chapters. It is a bright spot in the otherwise dark period of the Judges. In the story, God brings together Ruth of Moab and Boaz of Israel. Of great significance is the fact that Boaz and Ruth are in the genealogy of King David and of the Messiah, Jesus Christ (Matthew 1:5-6 and Luke 3:32).
