  Christ Really is Risen
description: >-
  After three days, Jesus rose from the grave (Easter Sunday). He is risen! He is risen indeed! He then saw his disciples several times in Jerusalem and gave them the "Great Commission" to take the "good news" (Gospel) of Jesus Christ into the entire world. He ascended into heaven (recorded in Mark, Luke and Acts). He is coming again!
