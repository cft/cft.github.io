  The End of the Age
description: >-
  Following Jesus' prediction of the destruction of the Temple, the disciples asked when this would happen and what the signs of his coming and the end of the age would be. A number of signs are given in this "Olivet Discourse" found in three gospels (Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21).
