  Jude 1:1-25

  Warning Against Nominal Christianity
description: >-
  This is the "sandwich epistle." Between a very positive opening and an even more positive ending of this short epistle there is "a strong warning against nominal Christianity." Christians are expected to be committed to their faith. There are five (really six) ways given to be a positive and committed Christian and thereby to build up the Christian fellowship.
