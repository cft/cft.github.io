  Goodbye to Sin
description: >-
  The issue of sin in the believer's life can be quite perplexing. John tells these believers what sin has done, what Jesus has done, and what salvation has done for us. Sin has ruined us. But Jesus appeared to take away our sins and to destroy the work of the devil. Salvation has made a radical difference in our lives.
