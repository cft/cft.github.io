  1st John 5:1-15, 18
name: >-
  Finding Our Focus
description: >-
  John saves some very important things for the close of this first letter. It is a crescendo of heart and mind as he gives them three tests (love, obedience, faith), three testimonies (water, blood, Spirit), and three assurances (eternal life, answered prayer, constant protection). What riches we have in Christ!
