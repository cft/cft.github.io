  Test the Spirits
description: >-
  As Christians we can sometimes be confused. We may feel guilty when there is no reason for guilt. False teachers from the cults will try to twist the truth. The opposing world gets strong in its influence. John attempts to encourage and strengthen these Christians to hold fast to their Christian faith.
